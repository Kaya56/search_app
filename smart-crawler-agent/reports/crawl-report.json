Email reports to errata2025 @ pglaf.org (remove the spaces around the @). Suggested formats for reports are described below. Corrections should be against the main source(s) of the Project Gutenberg books. These are usually found under the “more files” link on the landing page and are almost always a plain text (*.txt) and an HTML (.htm) file. It’s best to submit errata reports against these files found under “more files”. Other links on the landing page (such as www.gutenberg.org/928) are generated from the files under “more files”. However, please do not use the generated files as a basis for corrections.

We have multiple editions of some texts, like Homer’s “Odyssey,” and unless you tell us exactly what eBook you mean we have to spend much time searching and guessing which file you were reading. It is important to specify that you are reporting errors found in the text, html, .mobi or .epub file. It is usually easiest to cut and paste the line where the error is into your e-mail, with your comment. A report for a typical errata list might look like: The Odyssey, by Homer April, 1999 [EBook #1728] Line 884: back Telemachus, who bas now resided there for a month. \"bas\" should be \"has\" Line 1491: Ithaca yet stands. But I wouldask thee, friend, concerning \"would\" and \"ask\" are run together here Line 1563: in his father's seat and the elders gave place to him This is the end of a paragraph, and needs a period at end. Line 15346-7: 'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the will say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have I think there is something missing between \"the\" and \"will\" But the following gets the job done: In Homer's Odyssey, EBook #1728, I found the following errors: Telemachus, who bas now resided change \"bas\" to \"has\" But I wouldask thee, \"would ask\" run together and the elders gave place to him needs period ye men of Ithaca, to the will say. line missing between \"the\" and \"will\"? Or, even shorter and easiest to use: In Homer's \"Odyssey,\" EBook #1728, I found the following errors: Telemachus, who bas now resided bas ==> has But I wouldask thee, wouldask ==> would ask and the elders gave place to him him ==> him. ye men of Ithaca, to the will say. line or words missing between \"the\" and \"will\"? The common error of copying several lines or the entire paragraph which contains the error followed by the same paragraph with the error corrected makes it very difficult and time consuming for the editor to locate the error. Please use one of the errata report formats above. On the other hand it is also important to give a long enough portion of the line with the error as there may be dozens of instances of a short phrase. For example: to him him ==> him. may take 10 minutes or more of the editor’s time searching for “to him” if there are 100 instances of “to him” in the eBook. Experienced Project Gutenberg contributors may find that when there are a great many suspected errors it may be easiest all round just to submit a corrected version of the text and html files. If you are a regular, and have used any of the standard Gutenberg tools like “Gutcheck” or “Jeebies” to find errors, you might mention something like: “Gutcheck finds a lot of bad quotes”. When you are able to find the eBook’s title in an online eBook such as “The Internet Archive,” it is a great help to us if you verify your suggested changes and in your report let us know you have done so and the source used. Any errata submissions are freely made, without obligation, and are entirely in the public domain. If you are not sure whether your pull request was received, or need guidance on the process, email errata2025 @ pglaf.org.

Donate About▼ About Project Gutenberg Contact Us History & Philosophy Kindle & eReaders Help Pages Offline Catalogs Donate Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Reading Lists Search Options Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Project Gutenberg Permissions, Licensing and other Common Requests Overview Project Gutenberg receives many requests for permissions to use eBooks, images from eBooks, or extracts. Most such requests do not need a custom response, since permission is included in the items themselves (even for commercial use), or in the narrative below. This How-To provides responses to the most common inquiries. If your inquiry is not addressed, please email Dr. Newby with your permission requests. Responses are typically received within a day or so (or, re-send your request!). Contents Most permissions not needed Terms of Use Trademark Permission to “Trade On” the Project Gutenberg name Crediting Linking Project Gutenberg as Publisher Quotes and extracts from Project Gutenberg items Copyright page and trademarks from Source Citing Project Gutenberg No paperwork US only No “sweat of the brow” For copyrighted content Commercial use of Project Gutenberg trademark Higher resolution images More details on items Reporting errata Most permissions not needed Most permission requests we receive do not require a custom response. The vast majority of Project Gutenberg eBooks are in the public domain in the US. This means that nobody can grant, or withhold, permission to do with this item as you please. “As you please” includes any commercial use, republishing in any format, making derivative works or performances, etc. Read more about the public domain in Wikipedia. Terms of Use All use of the web site and content at www.gutenberg.org is subject to its Terms of Use. Find them on the main page of www.gutenberg.org. Trademark Permission to “Trade On” the Project Gutenberg name The name “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. The Small Print License guides terms of use. Basically, you need to pay royalties for commercial use (mentioned below). This restriction is mainly to prevent you selling things that might be mis-perceived as being sold and/or supported by Project Gutenberg, when Project Gutenberg has no involvement. It is intended to recognize the value of the Project Gutenberg name. No permission is needed for non-commercial use. So, for example, you can freely redistribute any eBook, anywhere, any time, with or without the “Project Gutenberg” trademark included. The Small Print has more details. Note that if you are not in the US, you must confirm yourself whether an item is free to redistribute where you are. Crediting No permission is needed to credit Project Gutenberg as the source of something you use. This applies even for commercial use. Linking No permission is needed to link to www.gutenberg.org or to any page or address within it. To link to a specific eBook, link to the landing page for that eBook, not to specific files. So, for example, you would link to www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033 rather than “deep linking” to the specific HTML, plain text, etc. www.gutenberg.org prohibits deep links automatically (based on the HTTP referrer), because from time to time the underlying structure of an eBook might change. More detail, mostly for webmasters, is in our linking document. Project Gutenberg as Publisher Project Gutenberg does not promise or enforce adherence to any particular source item. We typically make each eBook from a single print book, but sometimes multiple print books are used. Even with a single print book, we make many changes: spelling modernization, dehyphenation, conversion to HTML or other formats, etc. Therefore, we are the publisher of our eBooks, even if print sources were used from prior publishers. Sometimes an eBook will include mention of its source, and even then, this is not intended in any way that our eBooks are identical to that source print book. Quotes and extracts from Project Gutenberg items No permission is needed to use quotes from Project Gutenberg items (in the US, this would be “fair use”). This applies for all use, including commercial use. In other words, no royalties are due for quotes even if they are used for commercial products. It is always OK to cite Project Gutenberg as the publication source (see below for how to cite), and it is also OK to not cite Project Gutenberg: your choice. Copyright page and trademarks from Source Sometimes an eBook will include a transcription or image of the original title page, verso (obverse) or other pages from a source print book used for the eBook. This may include a copyright statement, which will usually be before 1964 (see our “copyright how-to” for details). This does not mean that item is still copyrighted. The header/footer in the eBook from Project Gutenberg will mention that such items are in the public domain in the US. Similarly, eBooks might include images or text that are (or were) trademarks in the US or elsewhere. This might include print publisher names or marks, publication associations, or marks depicted as images or words within the eBooks. Project Gutenberg is providing such items “as is,” with no representation of ownership, or whether any such marks are still active. It is permitted, but not required, for our volunteer eBook producers to include front matter from print books they use. Citing Project Gutenberg You can use any standard bibliographic format to cite the eBooks you find in Project Gutenberg. We use “Urbana, Illinois” as the publication source, since that is the long-time home of our efforts. Note that the publication date is also known as the “release date”, which is included in each Project Gutenberg eBook’s header information. Include illustrators, translators etc., as you would for any book. You should not cite Project Gutenberg or any eBook producers as “editors” unless they actually say they are edited (this happens rarely), because these eBooks are usually transcriptions, more or less, from printed sources. Here is an example in an APA-type format. Carroll, Lewis. (2006). <ul>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland<ul>. Urbana, Illinois: Project Gutenberg. Retrieved February 21, 2016, fromwww.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033. To cite the entire collection or Web site: Project Gutenberg. (n.d.). Retrieved June 21, 2025, from https://www.gutenberg.org. Of course, you should insert the actual year/date you accessed the item, and the actual year of your visit to the site. No paperwork Project Gutenberg does not fill out permission forms or otherwise grant permission for public domain items. That’s what “public domain” means: nobody can grant permission. We also do not process forms that somehow confirm non-copyright status. If you don’t trust the statement in an eBook that an item is in the public domain in the US, then some sort of form from the same place (PG) that made the public domain determination would be meaningless! If you need further assurances or research that an item is in the public domain, we recommend you arrange for the research yourself, to your own specifications. US only PG is entirely based in the US, and we follow the United States laws for copyright. Not all items that are public domain in the US are public domain in other countries, and vice versa. If you are operating outside of the US, you should get professional guidance on how to proceed for things like redistributing Project Gutenberg’s content. For basic information about copyright elsewhere, try this link to the Online books page. No “sweat of the brow” Project Gutenberg claims no copyright for markup, formatting, spelling modernization, etc., and neither can you (at least in the United States). See our No Sweat of the Brow How-To For copyrighted content There are thousands of items in the Project Gutenberg collection which are still under copyright protection. Each copyrighted item is clearly indicated as copyrighted in the eBook’s header. Unless there is an included license with the copyrighted item (such as a creative commons license), you will need to contact the copyright holder for any needed permission. Project Gutenberg cannot do this on your behalf, and does not have any ability to sublicense copyrighted works. Commercial use of Project Gutenberg trademark If you use the Project Gutenberg name, which is a registered trademark, you need to pay royalties for any commercial use (i.e., where you are trading on the Project Gutenberg trademarked name). Terms are spelled out clearly in the license included with each eBook, or read it here: License How-To If your commercial project has only a minor use of the Project Gutenberg trademark (for example, one PG eBook, and 9 from another source), then royalties are proportional. In this example of one in ten items from PG, you would pay only 1/10th of the royalties that would normally be due. In particular, this means that any attempt to claim copyright on a Project Gutenberg item that’s in the public domain, even after you “add value,” will be invalid. Higher resolution images If you’re looking for higher resolution versions of our scans, you will probably need to find your own original and make your own scan. Many Project Gutenberg volunteers produce our scans, and we have no good way to track them down in order to help you. The Distributed Proofreaders PGDP has some online forums (free registration required) where you can inquire after items that came from that source. Each eBook that DP contributes has a credit to them at the start. More details on items Each eBook is complete and self-contained. If you want more information about an author, a publisher, the printed source(s) used, etc. and it’s not in the eBook, we probably don’t know either. Try another resource, such as your local librarian. Project Gutenberg does not enforce adherence of its eBooks to any particular print source.

Deep Linking When linking to a Project Gutenberg item, link to the main landing page such as www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11. Do not link to specific files or anchors, such as http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm. Technical measures (i.e., cookies, captchas and similar) are utilized to ensure that links come from the landing page or elsewhere within www.gutenberg.org. If you need to link to a specific file or passage, please make your own copy of that file and host it on your own server. This measure is a protection against possible renaming or reorganizing the back end file structure, which has happened several times over the years. We intend the landing page to be permanent. Embedding or Wrapping our Site or Contents Applies mainly to website owners. We do not allow large-scale deep-linking to eBook files hosted on our servers. We reserve the right to take legal and technical measures against this. While the books we host are free, our server infrastructure and bandwidth is not. It is paid with money generously made available by our donors and partners. We will not tolerate mock Gutenberg front-ends that pocket advertising revenues while leaving the cost of actually serving the files to us. OPDS Feed Applies to OPDS application developers. Every application that uses our OPDS feed must: Use a proper user-agent, like: calibre/1.1.0 (+http://www.calibre.org). Always include a contact address like a web page or email, so we can reach you. Applications without contact address and application developers that do not respond to our inquiries will be blocked from using our OPDS feed. Make no more requests to our servers than a user with a browser typically would make (eg. for every search, request only one page of results, and automatically request the next page only if the users scrolls to the bottom of the previous page). If your application makes lots of requests, your users will be blocked at the IP level. For high-volume OPDS applications consider downloading our catalog database and hosting your own OPDS feed.

Donate About▼ About Project Gutenberg Contact Us History & Philosophy Kindle & eReaders Help Pages Offline Catalogs Donate Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Reading Lists Search Options Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Project Gutenberg Needs Your Donation Thank you for considering a donation to Project Gutenberg. Think of this as a contribution to later generations. These are remarkable times, and it is good to include you as part of the story. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is registered as a 501(c)(3) charity under the United States Internal Revenue Code, so your donation is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Contents Project Gutenberg is always free! Easy ways to Donate Using BuyMeACoffee Using PayPal Using the Give Freely browser extension By Check or Money Order Additional Detail on How To Donate About donations by BuyMeACoffee About donations by PayPal About donating by Check or Money Order About donating by Non-US Funds Check or Money Order Privacy Policy For Donations Project Gutenberg is always free! Project Gutenberg appreciates donations. They help to operate our minimalist infrastructure and pay our tiny staff, and most importantly to support volunteers who create new eBooks. The design of Project Gutenberg is that it will always be free: the content is available for unlimited free redistribution, and the main website is hosted without fees by iBiblio. Project Gutenberg’s founder, Michael Hart, was notoriously frugal. He never wanted to be dependent on specific funding levels, and instead insisted that Project Gutenberg would continue even if it had no funds. In support of this, he went for years without reliable income. Donations help Project Gutenberg to support its activity and augment its message, and to maintain the pace of around 200 new titles per month. There will never be a cost to access Project Gutenberg’s content, and everything at www.gutenberg.org will always be available for unlimited free redistribution. Easy ways to Donate Using BuyMeACoffee Visit BuyMeACoffee.com/projgutenberg to donate in $5 increments. You can make a one-time donation, or sign up for monthly donations. Cancel any time. Using PayPal Make a one-time donation: Make a monthly donation (cancel any time): One dollar : $1.00USD Five dollars : $5.00USD Ten dollars : $10.00USD Twenty-five dollars : $25.00USD One hundred dollars : $100.00USD Using the Give Freely browser extension Project Gutenberg has subscribed to Give Freely to provide options for readers to generate donations of funds. The Give Freely approach is to install a browser extension. The extension automatically detects when you visit a participating online merchant. Then, if you make a purchase, a donation is channeled from that merchant to your selected charity. There is no cost to you. The browser extension also helps to find coupons in the online merchant sites. Give Freely has a mission and philosophy that emphasizes transparency and accountability. This donation method is currently only available for people in the United States, Canada or the UK who are using the Chrome or Edge browser. Additional browser support is coming in summer 2024. Give Freely may not work for you if you already have ad blocker software installed. Project Gutenberg has a (Google-hosted) feedback form for any input you might have about using the Give Freely donation platform. The Give freely browser extension can be disabled or uninstalled at any time. By Check or Money Order Send a check or money order (any currency) to: Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation PO Box 16327 Salt Lake City, UT 84116 Note that since fall 2023 we have had problems with some mail sent to our USPS post office box being delayed significantly. Delays of up to 6 months have occurred. This has been frustrating for donors, as well as for Project Gutenberg, and has resulted in check deposits being delayed. Additional Detail on How To Donate Project Gutenberg’s success is due to the hard work of thousands of volunteers over more than 50 years. Your donations make it possible to support these volunteers, and pay our expenses to continue the creation of free electronic texts. Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, a non-profit corporation registered in the US State of Mississippi. PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541. There are several ways to donate. We want you to make a donation in the best way for you, so have tried to make it easy. In summary, BuyMeACoffee or PayPal are usually the easiest and most flexible payment methods. We can also accept mailed checks or money orders in any national currency, and a few other methods. If you want to make a donation in a way that’s not specified below, please contact us! PGLAF has participated in some employee matching programs, Benevity, and others. About donations by BuyMeACoffee BuyMeACoffee (or Buy Me A Coffee) is a website for donations that provides 100% of all donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. It requires no registration for donors. You can donate in any increment of $5. Five American dollars is envisioned as the nominal cost of a (rather fancy) cup of coffee. You can learn more about this donation platform on their FAQ page. Project Gutenberg is provided with your name and the donation amount, but is not provided your contact information (email, Twitter, or any other identification that you might have submitted. So, we cannot send a “thank you” note. If you need a tax receipt, be sure to save the payment information from the Buy Me A Coffee website. About donations by PayPal PayPal is a Web site that accepts credit cards, checks, and bank transfer payments. You need to set up a PayPal account to donate via PayPal (in the past, you could donate without setting up an account. This doesn’t seem to be possible any more). Visa, MasterCard, Amex and Discover are accepted. Because of PayPal’s fees, any donation of under 32 cents or so doesn’t reach PGLAF. Instead, consider letting your small donations add up to a dollar or more before sending it with PayPal. In addition to using the quick donation links above, you can also login to PayPal and select “Send Money.” When prompted, specify ‘donate2025@pglaf.org’ as the recipient, and you will be presented with PGLAF’s information. Send the payment as you would any other payment. Funds go directly to PGLAF via PayPal. Any national currency is OK. Be assured that you will not be added to any postal or email list or solicited further. You will get a “thank you” email from the CEO, and that is all. You are invited to subscribe to the email lists, but we do not subscribe you directly. This emailed thank you and your PayPal transaction record serve as your tax receipt for your donation. The fee charged by PayPal for your donation is their discounted rate for registered charities. This is 2.2% of the transaction plus 30 cents per transaction. For a $100 payment, this amounts to $2.50 or 2.5%. For $10, the fee is $0.52 or 5.2%. PayPal accepts non-US accounts and funds. We have learned that donations from some countries don’t work when using the PayPal links and buttons above. This is a known limitation of the way we link to PayPal. To enable all countries, we would need to modify the Project Gutenberg website so that all pages with donation links would first load PayPal’s software (JavaScript), and then load a specific remote link within Project Gutenberg’s pages. We don’t want PayPal’s software to be loaded for every visitor to Project Gutenberg, so have opted for an approach where nothing is loaded from PayPal until a Project Gutenberg visitor selects the PayPal link. For those countries where donations are not accepted via the links and buttons here, simply make a payment to our email address as described above. That seems to work everywhere. About donating by Check or Money Order Send a check or money order in US funds. Our address is: Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation PO Box 16327 Salt Lake City, UT 84116 The bank we utilize, Wells Fargo, does not charge any fees for our use of the bank account. They do charge a fee of at least $5 for depositing checks from outside the US or in non-US currency. Any donation of $100 or over will receive a written “thank you” via postal mail, unless you do not provide a return address. This written thank you and your cancelled check serve as your tax receipt for your donation. About donating by Non-US Funds Check or Money Order Send a check or money order in non-US funds. This can go to the same address as above. The bank charges a fee for processing non-US funds. This fee is difficult to know in advance, but usually seems to be five dollars or slightly more for checks of at least $USD 100 in value. The exchange rate to US funds is at market value. Privacy Policy For Donations In order to meet IRS tax regulations, PGLAF keeps track of the names, addresses, donation amounts and donation methods of non-anonymous donors. We normally send a postal or email “thank you” letter when we receive your donation over $100. We do not provide any information about donors to any party outside of PGLAF and its employees and contractors for any purpose, except if required by law. We will not send subsequent postal or electronic mail or attempt to phone you. We do not add you to any mailing list or email list. If you would like to subscribe to one of the Project Gutenberg email lists to receive the monthly newsletter or immediate notifications of new eBooks, please visit our mailing list pages for instructions.

They were created by volunteers, and have not been updated since 2020 so there are many books that are not included in these lists. Another way to find eBooks related to a topic is to use the “main categories” page or to browse the Bibliographic Record section of any eBook’s page.

In late September 2023 we began getting reports from people using Google Chrome who could no longer download EPUB or other formats. This seems to be due to a change in Chrome. Instead, try right-clicking then use the “Save as…” or similar menu to save to your computer. Or, try using a different web browser. Project Gutenberg is not just for your desktop or notebook computer! All modern tablets, smartphones, and eBook readers we know about can display Project Gutenberg eBooks. We are not going to try to list them all here, but every such device we are aware of has the ability to display one or more of Project Gutenberg’s typical file formats. Many MP3 players, gaming systems, and other devices can display eBooks, too. The Project Gutenberg site offers download formats suitable for eBook readers, mobile phones, and other devices. There are several different ways of obtaining and viewing the titles, and most people will be able to choose whichever suits them best. Before getting started, check with your device’s documentation to determine which formats you can display. This page lists the formats that Project Gutenberg offers. Here are some of the ways we know of to get Project Gutenberg eBooks to your eBook reader or mobile phone: Read the eBook online. All the devices we know about have the ability to display Web pages, and that is one of the formats available for nearly every Project Gutenberg eBook. Download eBooks directly to your device over the Internet. If your device is Internet-enabled, just visit the catalog landing page for a book, and download one of the formats your device can display. Here is a sample catalog landing page: www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11. Use the author/title search boxes on every page at www.gutenberg.org to find eBooks you are interested in. Download to your computer, and transfer (i.e., “side load”) to your device. This might be done with a USB cable, Bluetooth, or another method. Use a third party site or app (including some for-fee sites or apps), which facilitate getting files onto your device. Note that Project Gutenberg does not have any apps, and there are never logins or fees from Project Gutenberg. Use integration with services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. These download links are available on the landing pages, and some devices can automatically access files from them. Use Overdrive (Libby) or other apps used by libraries or others. Some libraries have free Project Gutenberg eBooks in their catalog, for download and reading alongside other books in their collections. Other methods, as supported by your device. For example, the Kindle supports an email method to transform and receive files. Search For Guidance Many articles have been written on different approaches to getting Project Gutenberg content onto different devices. Use your favorite search site to look for guidance. These include articles on specific devices, as well on how convert Gutenberg files to other formats. We don’t try to maintain a list of links here, since the articles tend to evolve rapidly as new devices and software come out. Instead, use your favorite web search engine to find the details you need. These Wikipedia links have information, listings, and comparisons that may be useful: Comparison of e-readers Comparison of e-book formats Comparison of Android e-reader software Comparison of iOS e-reader software General Advice There are a few different challenges that many people face. Here are some of the ones we hear about most often. Keep in mind that there are many different types of devices people use to access and read Project Gutenberg’s eBooks, and they can be set up differently and have different software. So, your specific experience might be a little different than someone else’s. This also means that step-by-step instructions might need some variation for your own situation. Save an eBook to transfer to your device. If you are using your computer to look at an eBook, you can save the eBook’s file(s) to your computer so that you can copy it to your device. Try the “File / Save as…” … “HTML Complete” or similar option in your Web browser to save the file(s) to a folder you choose, so that you can later transfer the files to your device. If you want to get a particular file format (often the EPUB format), from the Project Gutenberg download page you can right-click to get a pop-up menu, then “save as…” (or a similar option). If you don’t have a right mouse button (on some Macs), use control-click to get the pop-up menu. For HTML, make sure you save the complete page. Some Web browsers just download the HTML (the text), and link back to the images at the www.gutenberg.org site. This won’t work reliably, since viewing the book would then require you to be online. Project Gutenberg wants you to have the WHOLE eBook - download the complete HTML with images. All Web browsers offer this as a menu option, but it might not be the default choice. Where is the file? If you simply click a file to download, you might get a dialog box or something similar, asking whether you want to save the file. But where did it go? It seems there are many different places your computer or reader might save the file, and they can be hard to find later. Use the “save as…” method mentioned above to choose a specific location. Also, keep in mind that the Project Gutenberg files might have names that don’t related to the book’s title (we use a numeric file naming scheme based on the eBook number). You can rename the files to anything you’d like, but you will first need to know where they are saved. On tablets and ereaders, you might not be prompted for where to save your file, and we have had reports of different locations being used from time to time, or by different software. You might need to look around in your downloaded files areas. Get the file to my device. This varies quite a bit, but the first step is to find where you saved the file (sometimes you can save directly to your device, if it is connected). One common variation is to connect your device to your computer, often with a USB cable. This is called “tethering.” Then, just drag and drop (or use another method for copying files) to put the file on your device - this is often called “side loading.” Another common variation is to use a separate program that manages your device’s content, and to open the file and transfer it from within that program. Calibre is a good example of free software that works on many different devices and can help you to manage your eBook library. Hey, it doesn’t look right! Project Gutenberg relies on several automated steps to create EPUB and other eBook reader formats. For a variety of reasons, this automation sometimes yields files that don’t look right on every device, particularly those with small screens. One common problem is to have lots of white space at the top of an eBook, or very wide margins. Also, it might be that images (from the HTML version of the book) are not included in the automatically-generated version. If you got the right file, but it doesn’t look right, it’s probably not something you can fix. Try another file format, especially HTML or plain text. HTML and plain text can be viewed by many of the specialized eBook reader devices and mobile phones. I get an error that the file is protected by DRM Digital Rights Management, which is a way that some publishers use to prevent you from doing what you want with files they produce. Nothing in Project Gutenberg has DRM. But we’ve found that if a file is corrupted or changed, some devices mistakenly think they are protected by DRM. Try downloading again, or try different reading software (if possible), or try another file format. Kindle General Kindle Help Amazon makes it challenging to know what transfer method, and which file formats, are supported for your specific setup. Since late 2022, Amazon has shifted to prefer the new K8 or AZW format rather than MOBI, and has also increased support for the EPUB format. First consider using EPUB (specifically, EPUB version 3 or EPUB3), rather than Kindle (K8) formats. The EPUB files are smaller and supported by the Kindle app and most Kindle devices. You can also use “send to Kindle” with EPUB. Visit the Amazon help pages for your specific Kindle model. The help pages for the devices we looked all have a page describing how to transfer files from your computer to your Kindle, which is sometimes called “side loading.” Side loading usually seems to work most reliably: save to your computer, and then copy to your device. Here is Amazon’s device help page. There are too many different products, with sometimes differing software or features, for us to keep up. Your best solution will be to look for guidance for your specific situation. Amazon seems to remove support for some capabilities from older Kindles, including web browser support for the modern secure web (https). An alternative to side loading is to use Amazon’s “Send to Kindle” functionality. You can find Amazon’s information about this at amazon.com/sendtokindle. To send a Project Gutenberg eBook to your Kindle using this method, you must first visit the site above and tell Amazon what email address(es) you want to enable to email content to your Kindle. You also need to determine your personal Kindle email","links":["https://www.gutenberg.org/about/background/","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#nook","https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11","https://www.gutenberg.org/about/","https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/terms_of_use.html","https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_e-reader_software","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#general-kindle-help","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_iOS_e-reader_software","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#suggestions-from-project-gutenberg-founder-michael-hart","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#kindle","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/","https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#amazons-newer-file-format","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#remarkable2","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/file_formats.html","https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/permission.html","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#general-advice","https://hart.pglaf.org","https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#search-for-guidance","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-readers","http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200127470","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html","https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html","https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/categories","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#alternate-apps-and-formats","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats","https://calibre-ebook.com","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#ipad-iphone-and-ipod-touch","https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/","https://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact_information.html","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#project-gutenberg-is-not-just-for-your-desktop-or-notebook-computer","https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/privacy_policy.html","https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#kobo-reader","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#android","https://www.ibiblio.org/","https://www.gutenberg.org/","https://www.kobo.com/","https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mobile.html#kindle-3"],"mediaUrls":["https://www.gutenberg.org/gutenberg/ibiblio-logo.png","https://www.gutenberg.org/gutenberg/pg-logo-129x80.png"],"apiEndpoints":[],"isDynamic":false,"crawlTimestamp":1750692369231,"responseTime":1042,"httpStatus":200},{"url":"http://self.gutenberg.org#justDo","status":"SUCCESS","documentType":"web_page","title":"World eBook Library","description":"The World Library Foundation is the world's largest aggregator of eBooks.

GUTINDEX.AUS, Project Gutenberg of Australia Directory/Folder Listings You can navigate the directory/folder contents starting at /dirs, however this is not very user-friendly. The Project Gutenberg Catalog Metadata in Machine-Readable Format XML/RDF/CSV All Project Gutenberg metadata are available digitally in the XML/RDF format. This is updated daily (other than the legacy format mentioned below). Please use one of these files as input to a database or other tools you may be developing, instead of crawling or roboting the website. Note that the exact same metadata is available as a per-eBook .rdf file. These are found in the cache/epub (i.e., cache/generated) directory, accessible by mirroring or by the directory/folder listings above. The large XML/RDF file is simply a concatenation of all the per-eBook metadata. Project Gutenberg metadata does not include the original print source publication date(s). Because Project Gutenberg eBooks are substantially different from the source book(s), we track the Project Gutenberg publication date (“release date”), but do not include print source information in the metadata. Differences almost always include dehyphenation, removing page headers/footers, changes to typography during markup, and sometimes relocation of images, footnotes, captions, etc. In addition, Project Gutenberg eBooks sometimes come from multiple print editions. Many eBooks include scans of the title page or other pages, which may indicate original print publication. If matching a Project Gutenberg eBook to a particular print edition is important to you, it is likely this will need to be done by direct comparison of a print source with the eBook. An Excel-compatible CSV spreadsheet of eBook metadata is also available here. This file is updated once a week. MARC Records (MAchine Readable Cataloging) MARC is the lingua franca of library catalogs. It is a way of representing data about items like books. The data about items is known as metadata. Thanks to a partnership with the Free Ebook Foundation, Project Gutenberg metadata are available as a downloadable MARC file. Project Gutenberg’s MARC records, like the collection and most of its titles, are freely available. Libraries and others are encouraged to incorporate Project Gutenberg into their collections, in order to make Project Gutenberg’s titles more widely available at little or no cost. Note that the MARC metadata include all of the textual titles, but not non-textual titles such as audio, maps, and data sets. Metadata for those other items are available in the XML/RDF metadata described elsewhere on this page. To read more about the initiative to create the MARC records, including links to the software, issue reporting, and more, see this announcement from the Free Ebook Foundation. Find the MARC records in the feeds collection. The MARC records are regenerated weekly on Sundays. A Local, Browsable Copy on your own Computer or Mobile Device Kiwix is an application that lets you download a large collection and use it locally. A copy of the Project Gutenberg content was made available in November 2018, and may be updated periodically.

The word free in the English language does not distinguish between free of charge and freedom. Free of charge means that you don’t have to pay for the book you received. Freedom denotes that you may do as you like with the book you received. This distinction is immaterial if you just want to read a book privately, but it becomes of utmost importance if you want to work with the book: you are a teacher and want to use the book in class, you wrote a thesis about the book and want to distribute the book along with your thesis, you have a literary web site and want to distribute the book to your audience, or you are a writer and want to adapt the book for the stage. If the book you got is just free of charge but protected under U.S. copyright law, you may do none of the above things. You may not even make a copy of the book and give it to your best friend. But if the book you got is free as in freedom you may do anything you like with that book. Clearly free as in freedom beats free of charge. Fortunately almost all Project Gutenberg eBooks are free of charge and free as in freedom for readers within the United States (if you are not in the United States, you will need to determine what copyright law protects where you are located). Here are some real world examples of what people did with Project Gutenberg eBooks. A few Project Gutenberg eBooks are protected by U.S. copyright law. You can tell by reading the license inside the book. You may download our copyrighted books and give copies away, but might be limited in commercial uses and derivative works. Why are these books free? Copyright For the most part, copyright protection under U.S. law on the materials distributed by Project Gutenberg has expired. (They may still be copyrighted in other countries). So anybody located in the United States may make verbatim or non-verbatim copies of those works.

Donate About▼ About Project Gutenberg Contact Us History & Philosophy Kindle & eReaders Help Pages Offline Catalogs Donate Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Reading Lists Search Options Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Project Gutenberg Principle of Minimal Regulation/ Administration, by Michael Hart and Greg Newby Project Gutenberg is founded on the principle of Minimal supervision of our volunteers in their effort to promote our mission: To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks. We have found the best thing Project Gutenberg can do to achieve the mission is often to simply get out of the way and let our volunteers do what they like best, and then help them make any adjustments that might be necessary to get their work to the most readers. These non-interference principles mean the Project Gutenberg’s staff and the organization as a whole can do the most good by setting up a set of tools and infrastructure to create and distribute eBooks, and then let creative and energetic volunteers do work as they see fit. One of the outcomes of this principle is free experimentation with a lot of new ideas, even if these ideas break with past traditions and methods - or even common sense! Rather than saying, “NO,” to people with new ideas, Project Gutenberg strives to say, “YES,” and to back it up with assistance to get these new ideas into practical output. Another outcome of this principle of non-interference is a lack of a need for perfectionism. Project Gutenberg has always been a work in progress, a new way of doing things. Rather than trying to find the one “right way to create and distribute eBooks,” we believed in lots of ways, as many different “right” ways as people want to have. As Project Gutenberg operates on the principle of non-interference–our mission includes keeping the door open to people or projects for the creation of many a different ways of seeing things. The project recognizes a big role for people with more focused interests, or who prefer to work with a specific emphasis. When these interests match with the Gutenberg mission, these people and projects are welcome to function entirely or partially as part of Project Gutenberg, or in a mutually beneficial but non-exclusive way. When interests don’t get perfectly matched, Project Gutenberg is a supportive and encouraging force behind any efforts that help fulfill any similar missions. The Project Gutenberg organization consists of many individuals, all of whom have different motivations and interests. We are working to achieve a common mission: to create and distribute eBooks. Since no single organization or effort can be “just right” for everyone, even with a shared mission, Project Gutenberg works hard to remove all of the barriers that might stand between motivated individuals, groups, or other like minded organizations: these have created standards of their own to work on particular authors, formats, languages, etc. so we can provide you either with the freedom to create your eBooks for your own purposes and standards or to use prearranged standards. We recognize that our volunteers ARE volunteers, and that you should be given as much help or as much leeway, or both, as possible. The only barrier that Project Gutenberg seeks to maintain is the one that keeps notions such as dogmatism, perfectionism, elitism, format restrictions, content restrictions and so forth from restricting the freedom of people to create, read and distribute the eBooks they are interested in. This leads to a one of the Project Gutenberg mottos: Break Down the Bars of Ignorance and Illiteracy. Written by Michael S. Hart and Gregory B. Newby June 25, 2004. Updated October 23, 2004.

Donate About▼ About Project Gutenberg Contact Us History & Philosophy Kindle & eReaders Help Pages Offline Catalogs Donate Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Reading Lists Search Options Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Administrivia, by Michael Hart Project Gutenberg does not want to get bogged down in administrivia, thus we have administrators who have no desire for political powers, financial rewards, or to write more than the most minimal guidelines for the Project Gutenberg volunters. (See FAQ #0 for the freedom of the volunteers to do what they want as much as possible.) The minimal powers wielded by these Project Gutenberg administrators are divided into a traditional “Separation of Powers” between a CEO, Board of Directors and the intellectual property holder. The Board, as a requirement of the 501(c)(3) regulations must have a minimum of three members with certain oversight responsibilities, and we are in unanimous agreement that this board should remain minimal, both from the perspective of size and of responsibilities. We have no need of a large board that writes lengthy reports, multitudes of regulations and bylaws, or other administrivia; we try to have one reserve Board member in the wings, pre-approved by the rest of the Board in case a member becomes unavailable, and our CEO tries to never vote on Board decisions unless absolutely required as a tiebreaker. The holders of these positions have traditionally been with us for a period of over 10 years and understand the Project’s history and the developmental process that has taken place since its origin; none of them have any political or financial aspirations via their work with Project Gutenberg and they unanimously agree that there should not be power of that nature connected with Project Gutenberg. However, groups within Project Gutenberg are more than welcome to do their own creation of administrations and guidelines for themselves, as long as they fall within our minimal legal requirements and self-imposed quidelines. Yes, it would be nice to receive a billion dollars from Bill Gates–but–even then we would want to use that only to support a volunteer effort, not to create a plethora of paid positions or create more of a physical plant than is necessary. Project Gutenberg is a virtual, not physical, entity; run by volunteers, not by those who would make it a career, other than perhaps the one truly paid position of those who oversee the entire process in the most limited manner for future generations of our volunteers. If we do receive large grants or donations, these should not change the nature of Project Gutenberg in any manners that would prevent any of us from continuing Project Gutenberg if that money disappeared. No one should be able threaten Project Gutenberg financially. Having money is fine … becoming dependent on it should be avoided. Our clear position on adminstrative, political and financial power: Less is more. We want Project Gutenberg to stand for opening, not closing, doors. Written by Michael S. Hart June 20, 2004.

Hart, Founder of Project Gutenberg Electronic text has been with us virtually a long as the Internet and has been growing at the same rate, a rate that will soon make an impression on the average person, especially young people, and those involved in education, reading, and research. 10 years ago, in 1991, there were 18 eText/eBook files available, free for the taking, as the Internet was preparing to take off. Today there are about 18,000 listed in just one index, called The Internet Public Library and all are free for the taking. Without any increase in the rate of growth due to the advances we certainly expect over the next 10 years that number will increase to 18,000,000 … eventually covering virtually every work in the public domain. This will eventually become the primary driving force in a reason to buy computers … who wouldn’t consider it worthwhile to buy a collection of 18,000,000 titles for $1,000 in a box that fits any desk, on top or underneath, or even in laptop computers. Can this be true, you might ask? The average 300 page novel uses only 1 megabyte in plain eText!!! Thus the 18,000 such books listed today would take 18 gigabytes–at costs of much less than $100 … which can buy 40 gigabytes of drive today. Of course, most of the materials listed in Internet Public Library catalgues are well under 1 megabyte in size, so it is actually much cheaper. 10 years ago most people were using 40 MEGAbyte drives which cost $1500 when they were originally introduced, and Moore’s Law seems to barely be holding drive size in check, so we already see drive systems containing terabytes in computers costing under $10,000–which will be antiques in only a couple years. In fact drives of 100M have already fallen to under $300 as I proofread this, so an extra terabyte of space could be added to a $1,000 computer for a total of now under $5,000. 10 years from now, according to the current rate of drive prices, 40 terabyte systems will be around the various price range listed above, and will hopefully be continuing to fall. Our plan is for the Project Gutenberg collection to continue to fit approximately within 10% of the current drive standard. These eTexts can be improved literally overnight as readers email in reports of typographical errors that would never ever be fixed in paper editions. Think of the billions of hours students spend correcting errors in their textbooks when school starts each year of the 10-20 years we expect them to spend in school. How much is a billion student hours worth? Enough to promote eText? The first country to create an educational system based on eTexts will enjoy a huge advantage while other countries scramble to get a comparable system going … while some students are researching millions of online books, taking copious notes that are both fast and accurate, and easily footnoted, while others continue to file endless stacks of 3x5 notecards the same way it was done in 1900. Remember the 18,000,000 books that will be easily available? Look up the largest library collections in the world, and you may be amazed at just where a collection of 18,000,000 books would be ranked, even among the best city, university and national library collections in the world. Right now the only way to get your kid access to 18,000,000 books is to send them to a university with a tuition of over $25,000 per year. … And the eTexts are never checked out when you need them, never in for rebinding, never sitting on a cart waiting to be reshelved or reshelved in the wrong location. Their pages are never missing–they are never lost or stolen–and the library is never closed. Meanwhile, the cost to maintain such a library is vanishingly low … did you know the costs to put a book on the shelf of average add up to nearly $100 … and that average book is checked out an average of only 6 times??? The cost of the shelving alone is $3, for a book that only takes 1 inch. The average college student goes through hundreds of pounds of an assortment of textbooks, and you don’t want to know the price/lb, I assure you. Looking up a quotation in these books can be a big task, energy better spent between the ears, rather than lugging a hundred pounds of books home each year, and paging through 1,000s of pages seeking knowledge. … Knowledge doesn’t come from climbing up and down marble stairs to hunt for books in the dozen or so libraries of large universities or wading through the stacks looking for that obscure volume your bibliography absolutely requires. … With an electronic library the time spent searching, researching, and copying materials could literally be reduced by 90%. … Students used to spend 90% of their hours on research papers in a physical search for the data they needed, and only 10% in writing the actual paper … not a good ratio of research to thinking. With electronic libraries this could be easily reversed to 90% on thinking and only 10% doing the research … and I think that may be a conservative estimate. This should allow some combination of 10 times more research or a research paper that is 10 times better … either way, when these new papers enter the electronic library, a feedback loop is going to take place, because not only will the libraries have more data that is easier to find and use, but they will actually contain an assortment of newer and better data than we could have expected a similar population of scholars to produce with paper libraries. So, every computer could easily contain as many books as in major university libraries, with remote access to as many more. … For these reasons and more, eText is going to be the “killer app,” the Fountain of Youth, as it were, for the computer industry. As the average computer falls further and further below $1,000, a buyer becomes more and more likely to buy such a computer simply, even completely, to hold a library that will soon reach 20,000 of the books many people value as the most important in the world. Project Gutenberg was the first creator of eTexts on the Internet and has moved from producing about 10 titles in the year ending a decade ago to over 1,000 titles this year. With your help we can continue this growth rate and produce about 100,000 eTexts per year 10 years from today. There isn’t a better investment you could make in Microsoft or in the Seattle-Tacoma area, Washington State, or even the country or the world, than to invest in making Project Gutenberg eTexts. So get out your favorite checkbook … !

Donate About▼ About Project Gutenberg Contact Us History & Philosophy Kindle & eReaders Help Pages Offline Catalogs Donate Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Reading Lists Search Options Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Project Gutenberg Needs Your Donation Thank you for considering a donation to Project Gutenberg. Think of this as a contribution to later generations. These are remarkable times, and it is good to include you as part of the story. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is registered as a 501(c)(3) charity under the United States Internal Revenue Code, so your donation is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Contents Project Gutenberg is always free! Easy ways to Donate Using BuyMeACoffee Using PayPal Using the Give Freely browser extension By Check or Money Order Additional Detail on How To Donate About donations by BuyMeACoffee About donations by PayPal About donating by Check or Money Order About donating by Non-US Funds Check or Money Order Privacy Policy For Donations Project Gutenberg is always free! Project Gutenberg appreciates donations. They help to operate our minimalist infrastructure and pay our tiny staff, and most importantly to support volunteers who create new eBooks. The design of Project Gutenberg is that it will always be free: the content is available for unlimited free redistribution, and the main website is hosted without fees by iBiblio. Project Gutenberg’s founder, Michael Hart, was notoriously frugal. He never wanted to be dependent on specific funding levels, and instead insisted that Project Gutenberg would continue even if it had no funds. In support of this, he went for years without reliable income. Donations help Project Gutenberg to support its activity and augment its message, and to maintain the pace of around 200 new titles per month. There will never be a cost to access Project Gutenberg’s content, and everything at www.gutenberg.org will always be available for unlimited free redistribution. Easy ways to Donate Using BuyMeACoffee Visit BuyMeACoffee.com/projgutenberg to donate in $5 increments. You can make a one-time donation, or sign up for monthly donations. Cancel any time. Using PayPal Make a one-time donation: Make a monthly donation (cancel any time): One dollar : $1.00USD Five dollars : $5.00USD Ten dollars : $10.00USD Twenty-five dollars : $25.00USD One hundred dollars : $100.00USD Using the Give Freely browser extension Project Gutenberg has subscribed to Give Freely to provide options for readers to generate donations of funds. The Give Freely approach is to install a browser extension. The extension automatically detects when you visit a participating online merchant. Then, if you make a purchase, a donation is channeled from that merchant to your selected charity. There is no cost to you. The browser extension also helps to find coupons in the online merchant sites. Give Freely has a mission and philosophy that emphasizes transparency and accountability. This donation method is currently only available for people in the United States, Canada or the UK who are using the Chrome or Edge browser. Additional browser support is coming in summer 2024. Give Freely may not work for you if you already have ad blocker software installed. Project Gutenberg has a (Google-hosted) feedback form for any input you might have about using the Give Freely donation platform. The Give freely browser extension can be disabled or uninstalled at any time. By Check or Money Order Send a check or money order (any currency) to: Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation PO Box 16327 Salt Lake City, UT 84116 Note that since fall 2023 we have had problems with some mail sent to our USPS post office box being delayed significantly. Delays of up to 6 months have occurred. This has been frustrating for donors, as well as for Project Gutenberg, and has resulted in check deposits being delayed. Additional Detail on How To Donate Project Gutenberg’s success is due to the hard work of thousands of volunteers over more than 50 years. Your donations make it possible to support these volunteers, and pay our expenses to continue the creation of free electronic texts. Donations are made to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, a non-profit corporation registered in the US State of Mississippi. PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541. There are several ways to donate. We want you to make a donation in the best way for you, so have tried to make it easy. In summary, BuyMeACoffee or PayPal are usually the easiest and most flexible payment methods. We can also accept mailed checks or money orders in any national currency, and a few other methods. If you want to make a donation in a way that’s not specified below, please contact us! PGLAF has participated in some employee matching programs, Benevity, and others. About donations by BuyMeACoffee BuyMeACoffee (or Buy Me A Coffee) is a website for donations that provides 100% of all donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. It requires no registration for donors. You can donate in any increment of $5. Five American dollars is envisioned as the nominal cost of a (rather fancy) cup of coffee. You can learn more about this donation platform on their FAQ page. Project Gutenberg is provided with your name and the donation amount, but is not provided your contact information (email, Twitter, or any other identification that you might have submitted. So, we cannot send a “thank you” note. If you need a tax receipt, be sure to save the payment information from the Buy Me A Coffee website. About donations by PayPal PayPal is a Web site that accepts credit cards, checks, and bank transfer payments. You need to set up a PayPal account to donate via PayPal (in the past, you could donate without setting up an account. This doesn’t seem to be possible any more). Visa, MasterCard, Amex and Discover are accepted. Because of PayPal’s fees, any donation of under 32 cents or so doesn’t reach PGLAF. Instead, consider letting your small donations add up to a dollar or more before sending it with PayPal. In addition to using the quick donation links above, you can also login to PayPal and select “Send Money.” When prompted, specify ‘donate2025@pglaf.org’ as the recipient, and you will be presented with PGLAF’s information. Send the payment as you would any other payment. Funds go directly to PGLAF via PayPal. Any national currency is OK. Be assured that you will not be added to any postal or email list or solicited further. You will get a “thank you” email from the CEO, and that is all. You are invited to subscribe to the email lists, but we do not subscribe you directly. This emailed thank you and your PayPal transaction record serve as your tax receipt for your donation. The fee charged by PayPal for your donation is their discounted rate for registered charities. This is 2.2% of the transaction plus 30 cents per transaction. For a $100 payment, this amounts to $2.50 or 2.5%. For $10, the fee is $0.52 or 5.2%. PayPal accepts non-US accounts and funds. We have learned that donations from some countries don’t work when using the PayPal links and buttons above. This is a known limitation of the way we link to PayPal. To enable all countries, we would need to modify the Project Gutenberg website so that all pages with donation links would first load PayPal’s software (JavaScript), and then load a specific remote link within Project Gutenberg’s pages. We don’t want PayPal’s software to be loaded for every visitor to Project Gutenberg, so have opted for an approach where nothing is loaded from PayPal until a Project Gutenberg visitor selects the PayPal link. For those countries where donations are not accepted via the links and buttons here, simply make a payment to our email address as described above. That seems to work everywhere. About donating by Check or Money Order Send a check or money order in US funds. Our address is: Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation PO Box 16327 Salt Lake City, UT 84116 The bank we utilize, Wells Fargo, does not charge any fees for our use of the bank account. They do charge a fee of at least $5 for depositing checks from outside the US or in non-US currency. Any donation of $100 or over will receive a written “thank you” via postal mail, unless you do not provide a return address. This written thank you and your cancelled check serve as your tax receipt for your donation. About donating by Non-US Funds Check or Money Order Send a check or money order in non-US funds. This can go to the same address as above. The bank charges a fee for processing non-US funds. This fee is difficult to know in advance, but usually seems to be five dollars or slightly more for checks of at least $USD 100 in value. The exchange rate to US funds is at market value. Privacy Policy For Donations In order to meet IRS tax regulations, PGLAF keeps track of the names, addresses, donation amounts and donation methods of non-anonymous donors. We normally send a postal or email “thank you” letter when we receive your donation over $100. We do not provide any information about donors to any party outside of PGLAF and its employees and contractors for any purpose, except if required by law. We will not send subsequent postal or electronic mail or attempt to phone you. We do not add you to any mailing list or email list. If you would like to subscribe to one of the Project Gutenberg email lists to receive the monthly newsletter or immediate notifications of new eBooks, please visit our mailing list pages for instructions.

Donate About▼ About Project Gutenberg Contact Us History & Philosophy Kindle & eReaders Help Pages Offline Catalogs Donate Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Reading Lists Search Options Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Project Gutenberg Permissions, Licensing and other Common Requests Overview Project Gutenberg receives many requests for permissions to use eBooks, images from eBooks, or extracts. Most such requests do not need a custom response, since permission is included in the items themselves (even for commercial use), or in the narrative below. This How-To provides responses to the most common inquiries. If your inquiry is not addressed, please email Dr. Newby with your permission requests. Responses are typically received within a day or so (or, re-send your request!). Contents Most permissions not needed Terms of Use Trademark Permission to “Trade On” the Project Gutenberg name Crediting Linking Project Gutenberg as Publisher Quotes and extracts from Project Gutenberg items Copyright page and trademarks from Source Citing Project Gutenberg No paperwork US only No “sweat of the brow” For copyrighted content Commercial use of Project Gutenberg trademark Higher resolution images More details on items Reporting errata Most permissions not needed Most permission requests we receive do not require a custom response. The vast majority of Project Gutenberg eBooks are in the public domain in the US. This means that nobody can grant, or withhold, permission to do with this item as you please. “As you please” includes any commercial use, republishing in any format, making derivative works or performances, etc. Read more about the public domain in Wikipedia. Terms of Use All use of the web site and content at www.gutenberg.org is subject to its Terms of Use. Find them on the main page of www.gutenberg.org. Trademark Permission to “Trade On” the Project Gutenberg name The name “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. The Small Print License guides terms of use. Basically, you need to pay royalties for commercial use (mentioned below). This restriction is mainly to prevent you selling things that might be mis-perceived as being sold and/or supported by Project Gutenberg, when Project Gutenberg has no involvement. It is intended to recognize the value of the Project Gutenberg name. No permission is needed for non-commercial use. So, for example, you can freely redistribute any eBook, anywhere, any time, with or without the “Project Gutenberg” trademark included. The Small Print has more details. Note that if you are not in the US, you must confirm yourself whether an item is free to redistribute where you are. Crediting No permission is needed to credit Project Gutenberg as the source of something you use. This applies even for commercial use. Linking No permission is needed to link to www.gutenberg.org or to any page or address within it. To link to a specific eBook, link to the landing page for that eBook, not to specific files. So, for example, you would link to www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033 rather than “deep linking” to the specific HTML, plain text, etc. www.gutenberg.org prohibits deep links automatically (based on the HTTP referrer), because from time to time the underlying structure of an eBook might change. More detail, mostly for webmasters, is in our linking document. Project Gutenberg as Publisher Project Gutenberg does not promise or enforce adherence to any particular source item. We typically make each eBook from a single print book, but sometimes multiple print books are used. Even with a single print book, we make many changes: spelling modernization, dehyphenation, conversion to HTML or other formats, etc. Therefore, we are the publisher of our eBooks, even if print sources were used from prior publishers. Sometimes an eBook will include mention of its source, and even then, this is not intended in any way that our eBooks are identical to that source print book. Quotes and extracts from Project Gutenberg items No permission is needed to use quotes from Project Gutenberg items (in the US, this would be “fair use”). This applies for all use, including commercial use. In other words, no royalties are due for quotes even if they are used for commercial products. It is always OK to cite Project Gutenberg as the publication source (see below for how to cite), and it is also OK to not cite Project Gutenberg: your choice. Copyright page and trademarks from Source Sometimes an eBook will include a transcription or image of the original title page, verso (obverse) or other pages from a source print book used for the eBook. This may include a copyright statement, which will usually be before 1964 (see our “copyright how-to” for details). This does not mean that item is still copyrighted. The header/footer in the eBook from Project Gutenberg will mention that such items are in the public domain in the US. Similarly, eBooks might include images or text that are (or were) trademarks in the US or elsewhere. This might include print publisher names or marks, publication associations, or marks depicted as images or words within the eBooks. Project Gutenberg is providing such items “as is,” with no representation of ownership, or whether any such marks are still active. It is permitted, but not required, for our volunteer eBook producers to include front matter from print books they use. Citing Project Gutenberg You can use any standard bibliographic format to cite the eBooks you find in Project Gutenberg. We use “Urbana, Illinois” as the publication source, since that is the long-time home of our efforts. Note that the publication date is also known as the “release date”, which is included in each Project Gutenberg eBook’s header information. Include illustrators, translators etc., as you would for any book. You should not cite Project Gutenberg or any eBook producers as “editors” unless they actually say they are edited (this happens rarely), because these eBooks are usually transcriptions, more or less, from printed sources. Here is an example in an APA-type format. Carroll, Lewis. (2006). <ul>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland<ul>. Urbana, Illinois: Project Gutenberg. Retrieved February 21, 2016, fromwww.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033. To cite the entire collection or Web site: Project Gutenberg. (n.d.). Retrieved June 21, 2025, from https://www.gutenberg.org. Of course, you should insert the actual year/date you accessed the item, and the actual year of your visit to the site. No paperwork Project Gutenberg does not fill out permission forms or otherwise grant permission for public domain items. That’s what “public domain” means: nobody can grant permission. We also do not process forms that somehow confirm non-copyright status. If you don’t trust the statement in an eBook that an item is in the public domain in the US, then some sort of form from the same place (PG) that made the public domain determination would be meaningless! If you need further assurances or research that an item is in the public domain, we recommend you arrange for the research yourself, to your own specifications. US only PG is entirely based in the US, and we follow the United States laws for copyright. Not all items that are public domain in the US are public domain in other countries, and vice versa. If you are operating outside of the US, you should get professional guidance on how to proceed for things like redistributing Project Gutenberg’s content. For basic information about copyright elsewhere, try this link to the Online books page. No “sweat of the brow” Project Gutenberg claims no copyright for markup, formatting, spelling modernization, etc., and neither can you (at least in the United States). See our No Sweat of the Brow How-To For copyrighted content There are thousands of items in the Project Gutenberg collection which are still under copyright protection. Each copyrighted item is clearly indicated as copyrighted in the eBook’s header. Unless there is an included license with the copyrighted item (such as a creative commons license), you will need to contact the copyright holder for any needed permission. Project Gutenberg cannot do this on your behalf, and does not have any ability to sublicense copyrighted works. Commercial use of Project Gutenberg trademark If you use the Project Gutenberg name, which is a registered trademark, you need to pay royalties for any commercial use (i.e., where you are trading on the Project Gutenberg trademarked name). Terms are spelled out clearly in the license included with each eBook, or read it here: License How-To If your commercial project has only a minor use of the Project Gutenberg trademark (for example, one PG eBook, and 9 from another source), then royalties are proportional. In this example of one in ten items from PG, you would pay only 1/10th of the royalties that would normally be due. In particular, this means that any attempt to claim copyright on a Project Gutenberg item that’s in the public domain, even after you “add value,” will be invalid. Higher resolution images If you’re looking for higher resolution versions of our scans, you will probably need to find your own original and make your own scan. Many Project Gutenberg volunteers produce our scans, and we have no good way to track them down in order to help you. The Distributed Proofreaders PGDP has some online forums (free registration required) where you can inquire after items that came from that source. Each eBook that DP contributes has a credit to them at the start. More details on items Each eBook is complete and self-contained.

Donate About▼ About Project Gutenberg Contact Us History & Philosophy Kindle & eReaders Help Pages Offline Catalogs Donate Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Reading Lists Search Options Frequently Downloaded Main Categories Project Gutenberg Permissions, Licensing and other Common Requests Overview Project Gutenberg receives many requests for permissions to use eBooks, images from eBooks, or extracts. Most such requests do not need a custom response, since permission is included in the items themselves (even for commercial use), or in the narrative below. This How-To provides responses to the most common inquiries. If your inquiry is not addressed, please email Dr. Newby with your permission requests. Responses are typically received within a day or so (or, re-send your request!). Contents Most permissions not needed Terms of Use Trademark Permission to “Trade On” the Project Gutenberg name Crediting Linking Project Gutenberg as Publisher Quotes and extracts from Project Gutenberg items Copyright page and trademarks from Source Citing Project Gutenberg No paperwork US only No “sweat of the brow” For copyrighted content Commercial use of Project Gutenberg trademark Higher resolution images More details on items Reporting errata Most permissions not needed Most permission requests we receive do not require a custom response. The vast majority of Project Gutenberg eBooks are in the public domain in the US. This means that nobody can grant, or withhold, permission to do with this item as you please. “As you please” includes any commercial use, republishing in any format, making derivative works or performances, etc. Read more about the public domain in Wikipedia. Terms of Use All use of the web site and content at www.gutenberg.org is subject to its Terms of Use. Find them on the main page of www.gutenberg.org. Trademark Permission to “Trade On” the Project Gutenberg name The name “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. The Small Print License guides terms of use. Basically, you need to pay royalties for commercial use (mentioned below). This restriction is mainly to prevent you selling things that might be mis-perceived as being sold and/or supported by Project Gutenberg, when Project Gutenberg has no involvement. It is intended to recognize the value of the Project Gutenberg name. No permission is needed for non-commercial use. So, for example, you can freely redistribute any eBook, anywhere, any time, with or without the “Project Gutenberg” trademark included. The Small Print has more details. Note that if you are not in the US, you must confirm yourself whether an item is free to redistribute where you are. Crediting No permission is needed to credit Project Gutenberg as the source of something you use. This applies even for commercial use. Linking No permission is needed to link to www.gutenberg.org or to any page or address within it. To link to a specific eBook, link to the landing page for that eBook, not to specific files. So, for example, you would link to www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033 rather than “deep linking” to the specific HTML, plain text, etc. www.gutenberg.org prohibits deep links automatically (based on the HTTP referrer), because from time to time the underlying structure of an eBook might change. More detail, mostly for webmasters, is in our linking document. Project Gutenberg as Publisher Project Gutenberg does not promise or enforce adherence to any particular source item. We typically make each eBook from a single print book, but sometimes multiple print books are used. Even with a single print book, we make many changes: spelling modernization, dehyphenation, conversion to HTML or other formats, etc. Therefore, we are the publisher of our eBooks, even if print sources were used from prior publishers. Sometimes an eBook will include mention of its source, and even then, this is not intended in any way that our eBooks are identical to that source print book. Quotes and extracts from Project Gutenberg items No permission is needed to use quotes from Project Gutenberg items (in the US, this would be “fair use”). This applies for all use, including commercial use. In other words, no royalties are due for quotes even if they are used for commercial products. It is always OK to cite Project Gutenberg as the publication source (see below for how to cite), and it is also OK to not cite Project Gutenberg: your choice. Copyright page and trademarks from Source Sometimes an eBook will include a transcription or image of the original title page, verso (obverse) or other pages from a source print book used for the eBook. This may include a copyright statement, which will usually be before 1964 (see our “copyright how-to” for details). This does not mean that item is still copyrighted. The header/footer in the eBook from Project Gutenberg will mention that such items are in the public domain in the US. Similarly, eBooks might include images or text that are (or were) trademarks in the US or elsewhere. This might include print publisher names or marks, publication associations, or marks depicted as images or words within the eBooks. Project Gutenberg is providing such items “as is,” with no representation of ownership, or whether any such marks are still active. It is permitted, but not required, for our volunteer eBook producers to include front matter from print books they use. Citing Project Gutenberg You can use any standard bibliographic format to cite the eBooks you find in Project Gutenberg. We use “Urbana, Illinois” as the publication source, since that is the long-time home of our efforts. Note that the publication date is also known as the “release date”, which is included in each Project Gutenberg eBook’s header information. Include illustrators, translators etc., as you would for any book. You should not cite Project Gutenberg or any eBook producers as “editors” unless they actually say they are edited (this happens rarely), because these eBooks are usually transcriptions, more or less, from printed sources. Here is an example in an APA-type format. Carroll, Lewis. (2006). <ul>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland<ul>. Urbana, Illinois: Project Gutenberg. Retrieved February 21, 2016, fromwww.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19033. To cite the entire collection or Web site: Project Gutenberg. (n.d.). Retrieved June 21, 2025, from https://www.gutenberg.org. Of course, you should insert the actual year/date you accessed the item, and the actual year of your visit to the site. No paperwork Project Gutenberg does not fill out permission forms or otherwise grant permission for public domain items. That’s what “public domain” means: nobody can grant permission. We also do not process forms that somehow confirm non-copyright status. If you don’t trust the statement in an eBook that an item is in the public domain in the US, then some sort of form from the same place (PG) that made the public domain determination would be meaningless! If you need further assurances or research that an item is in the public domain, we recommend you arrange for the research yourself, to your own specifications. US only PG is entirely based in the US, and we follow the United States laws for copyright. Not all items that are public domain in the US are public domain in other countries, and vice versa. If you are operating outside of the US, you should get professional guidance on how to proceed for things like redistributing Project Gutenberg’s content. For basic information about copyright elsewhere, try this link to the Online books page. No “sweat of the brow” Project Gutenberg claims no copyright for markup, formatting, spelling modernization, etc., and neither can you (at least in the United States). See our No Sweat of the Brow How-To For copyrighted content There are thousands of items in the Project Gutenberg collection which are still under copyright protection. Each copyrighted item is clearly indicated as copyrighted in the eBook’s header. Unless there is an included license with the copyrighted item (such as a creative commons license), you will need to contact the copyright holder for any needed permission. Project Gutenberg cannot do this on your behalf, and does not have any ability to sublicense copyrighted works. Commercial use of Project Gutenberg trademark If you use the Project Gutenberg name, which is a registered trademark, you need to pay royalties for any commercial use (i.e., where you are trading on the Project Gutenberg trademarked name). Terms are spelled out clearly in the license included with each eBook, or read it here: License How-To If your commercial project has only a minor use of the Project Gutenberg trademark (for example, one PG eBook, and 9 from another source), then royalties are proportional. In this example of one in ten items from PG, you would pay only 1/10th of the royalties that would normally be due. In particular, this means that any attempt to claim copyright on a Project Gutenberg item that’s in the public domain, even after you “add value,” will be invalid. Higher resolution images If you’re looking for higher resolution versions of our scans, you will probably need to find your own original and make your own scan. Many Project Gutenberg volunteers produce our scans, and we have no good way to track them down in order to help you. The Distributed Proofreaders PGDP has some online forums (free registration required) where you can inquire after items that came from that source. Each eBook that DP contributes has a credit to them at the start. More details on items Each eBook is complete and self-contained. If you want more information about an author, a publisher, the printed source(s) used, etc. and it’s not in the eBook, we probably don’t know either. Try another resource, such as your local librarian. Project Gutenberg does not enforce adherence of its eBooks to any particular print source.

Join Our Ever Expanding Client List FAQ What is dedicated WordPress hosting? A dedicated server is a hosting environment where all the resources are exclusively allocated to a single client. At Kinsta, our highly-tuned hosting stack powered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP) handles most sites efficiently. However, for very high-traffic sites that can’t effectively use page caching or need extremely high levels of CPU and RAM, dedicated servers offer the additional resources required to ensure optimal performance. Do I need dedicated WordPress hosting? If your website receives a lot of visitors or temporary surges in traffic; has complex and high CPU or RAM demands; or if you have strict security or conformity requirements, then a dedicated server could be a good solution for you. Dedicated servers provide the client with a server that is solely assigned to their use, providing efficiency and dependability to sites that need it most. What is the difference between shared hosting and dedicated hosting? Dedicated hosting is the opposite of shared hosting. With dedicated hosting, you have the whole server to yourself, making it perfect for sites

As “WordPress guardians”, Motto’s high-value plans and products include development, hosting, domains, branding, and site speed. Motto’s clients are able to focus on other elements of their business knowing their sites are left in good hands. Check out our interview below with Motto CEO Julian Fernandez, CTO Greg Hunt, and Senior Developer Quentin Petitjean to learn more about their experience with Kinsta. Snapshot Industry: Web Agency Company Size: 1-20 The Problem Motto needed a WordPress host whose service aligned with the level of reliability and speed Motto wanted to provide their customers. In order to provide their clients with the full WordPress experience, Motto needed a reliable host that was as serious about speed and support as they were. Before discovering Kinsta, Motto tested a few different hosting options, all of which fell flat, especially when it came to support. “We tried SiteGround because they claimed to have WordPress-specific hosting and Motto is competitive on reseller hosting. However, we came to find out there was nothing special at all about their WordPress hosting besides the fact that it could run WordPress on a LAMP stack. Their support also never had good resolutions, always needed to be escalated, and was slow. We then rolled our own on DigitalOcean. While we had much more control, this led to higher administrative and opportunity costs just to keep it running properly. We then started building our own tools but this was time away from the business. We also tried managing tools like RunCloud, however, the support provided here was very limited and still required us to troubleshoot many issues ourselves.” The Solution Motto no longer has to take time away from the business to think about hosting. Kinsta provides the speed, security, and support they need for their clients’ sites. CTO Greg Hunt was immediately impressed with Kinsta’s focus on the developer experience. Additional tools, like Kinsta’s server-level caching and dashboard analytics features, were the icing on top. From the perspective of Senior Developer, Quentin Petitjean appreciated that he was able to speak directly with a highly-skilled WordPress support engineer, rather than moving up the never-ending support ladder other services have. The Result Trusting their clients’ sites to Kinsta gave Motto peace of mind, impressed their clients, sped up the sites they manage, and helped them save money. Motto was able to eliminate all of the extra costs associated with the hosting management of their WordPress sites, including the retainer for our system’s administrator. They received roughly a 50% increase in performance (decreased page load time) over most of their migrated sites. Most issues brought to Kinsta support are resolved in hours, not days, and Motto is able to get to the bottom of a lot more of them. Motto’s team can now focus on site and product development knowing their sites are constantly online, monitored, and backed up by Kinsta. Kinsta’s platform and staff really feel like an extension of our own team. They’re exactly what we needed. Greg Hunt CTO at Motto jesseluimes Looking for results similar to this agency?

Kinsta handles updates for you so your site stays secure and stable. Time is money No more logging in and manually updating plugins. Kinsta does it for you so you can focus on what matters. Stay secure Outdated plugins are a security risk. We update them automatically, test for issues, and roll back bad updates before they cause problems. Enjoy peace of mind A bad update can break your site, but not with Kinsta. Before updating, we take a backup. If an update fails, we restore the backup instantly—no downtime, no stress. Know when something goes wrong Before updating your plugins and themes, we capture a screenshot of your site and compare it after the update using visual regression testing (VRT). If a layout shifts, a button disappears, or something breaks, we roll back instantly and notify you. Pixel-by-pixel comparison If anything looks off, like a layout shift, missing button, or broken design, we automatically roll back to the last working version. Instant rollback protection If a plugin or theme update causes issues, such as broken layouts or missing elements, Kinsta instantly restores your site to its last working version before your visitors even notice. Detailed error message You’ll receive an email with the list of updated plugins and themes. If an issue occurs, we notify you and restore your site to the backup prior to the update. Take control with granular settings Every WordPress site is different, and updates shouldn’t be one-size-fits-all. With Automatic Updates, you have full control over how updates are handled so they fit your site’s unique needs. Schedule options Schedule updates daily or on selected days, and choose a 2-hour time window that works best for your site. Adjust sensitivity Control how strict the visual tests are so only the most important changes get flagged. Select test pages Define up to five key pages on your site for targeted testing after updates. CSS Selectors Skip dynamic elements like sliders or ads from testing to avoid false positives. Maintenance mode Enable maintenance mode during updates to keep visitors from seeing a broken or incomplete site. Notifications Get notified when updates run, when visual changes are detected, and if a rollback occurs. Kinsta just eliminated the biggest headache in the WordPress CMS: Outdated plugins & theme files.

We knew there was a better way to work. That’s why we created ClickUp— first an internal tool, now as a way to fulfill our vision of making the world more productive.” More than just task management, ClickUp offers hundreds of customizable features including Docs, Whiteboards, Reminders, Goals, Calendars, and even an email inbox. The platform is fully customizable and integrates with over 1,000 other work tools, making it the optimal work management solution for every type of team. Read our interview below with Lydia Minehan-Tubic, HTML and CSS Engineer at ClickUp. Snapshot Industry: Productivity Software Company Size: 800 The Problem In discussions across teams at ClickUp, there were concerns about maintenance and reliability stemming from past experiences with the WordPress based blog. “From the DevOps perspective, we didn’t have anyone who was an expert on maintaining and operating the WordPress stack. As a result, it wasn’t getting the care and attention it needed. We either needed to hire someone to manage it or offload it to a third party. Maintaining an entirely separate set of infrastructure and tech stack for one part of the overall ClickUp organization requires effort that could be better dedicated elsewhere, which is why we went with Kinsta as that third party. Plus, we were in the midst of a major blog redesign, so it was prudent to reenvision hosting and infrastructure while the blog was also being rethought.” The Solution Knowing that Kinsta enterprise hosting could reliably take care of specific WordPress security measures on our blog meant our DevOps team could prioritize the security of our platform. “Kinsta provided migration services to streamline the process. We needed a reverse proxy for the blog which was also a service offered by Kinsta. We were told our current setup including CloudFront, reverse proxy, plugins, etc. should transfer over without issue.” The Result ClickUp saw improvements across the board, from transparency around blog analytics and visits to an easy-to-use staging site to excellent customer support. “Kinsta provides clear visibility into the status of the blog and our server via the dashboard. Additionally, the staging instance Kinsta offers makes it easy for our marketing team to review new features and bug fixes.” Daily backups also proved to be invaluable to the ClickUp team. “Kinsta provides daily backups of both the Live and Staging instances of our blog. You also can conveniently login to PHPmyAdmin from site info to access the database. Plus, you have visibility into error logs which can help with debugging.” And finally, “The customer support from Kinsta is top-notch, with representatives thoughtfully responding to requests within minutes .” Kinsta is a great third party provider for managing and serving WordPress blogs. They take care of security for you so you can focus on the exciting stuff like theme development and new features for your blog.

However, when it comes to managed WordPress hosting, it doesn’t offer the support, premium features, or prices that Kinsta does. Cloudways is mainly a server reseller, not specialized in managed WordPress hosting. On the other hand, Kinsta is an expert in managed WP hosting for 10 years and is well-known for top website performance, world-class support, and the powerful MyKinsta dashboard that makes website management a breeze. More than 120,000+ clients all across the world, including some of the biggest companies in the world, rely on Kinsta. We know that everyday WordPress and website users are looking for an alternative hosting solution to Cloudways that combines better infrastructure and performance, along with faster and better support. Kinsta provides all these and much more! Cloudways was acquired by DigitalOcean in August 2022. How Kinsta Compares to Cloudways Hosting in a Nutshell Kinsta’s infrastructure is fully containerized and powered exclusively by the Google Cloud Platform on Google’s Premium Tier network, enabling us to provide you with a large selection of the fastest data servers, incredible performance, server-level caching, dedicated resources, and enhanced security. Gone are the days of worrying about sharing resources with other sites, including your own! All sites on Kinsta are protected by our enterprise-level premium Cloudflare integration, free for all customers. It includes a secure firewall, HTTP/3 support, DDoS protection, free CDN, and other benefits. You also experience transparent resource consumption, costs, and pricing. We are also proud to be the highest-rated managed WordPress host on G2, the world’s leading software review and comparison site.

Sign Up and Request a Free Migration Today Kinsta vs Cloudways Let’s take a look at some of the major differences between Kinsta and Cloudways: Kinsta is a leading managed WordPress hosting provider that offers all-in-one solutions for managing your website and supports 37 data centers across Google’s global network. Cloudways is a cloud hosting and server reseller platform that is not specific to WordPress. Kinsta uses C3D and C2 VMs (GCP’s fastest servers) for all plans in supported locations. In our tests, we found that C2 VMs are up to 200% faster than GCP’s lower-tier machines, while C3D machines reduced response times by a further 20% to 50%. Sites on Kinsta are equipped with a self-healing PHP feature. We monitor all sites on our infrastructure 480 times per day and offer an uptime guarantee. Cloudways only includes monitoring services as a paid add-on. Sites on Kinsta are covered by our Malware Security Pledge. At Cloudways, you have to pay for a premium upgrade to get Malware coverage. Kinsta is well-known for its world-class support, composed of WordPress experts and Linux engineers, available 24/7 for all our customers via live chat, with an average response time of under 2 minutes. We offer multilingual support across all of our plans, and our engineers are experienced and capable of solving any hosting issue on your WP site. Cloudways premium support is only available as a paid add-on, starting at $100 per month. Kinsta offers free migrations from Cloudways handled by an expert engineer. You can rest assured that your site will be migrated safely, securely, and following best practices. Cloudways doesn’t offer expert assistance migration services, only a dedicated “do it yourself” plugin, which means you have to do the migrations on your own, so you won’t receive a white-glove migration experience specifically tailored to your site. Containerized Solution. Kinsta offers a unique infrastructure that containerizes site resources so they don’t have to share. This increases and levels your performance on a per-site basis. No more worrying about sites you don’t manage potentially stealing your resources. It also helps minimize your time spent troubleshooting performance issues as you no longer have to account for potential resource stealing. Because of Kinsta’s unique containerized hosting, you can also host multiple sites on multiple data centers, all within the same plan! No more having to pay for multiple servers just to host sites in different locations. Help your clients get an instant performance boost by simply hosting their site on a server that’s more appropriately located for their customer base. While Cloudways offers some caching through a dedicated caching plugin, Kinsta has a unique system that caches pages at the server level. Our built-in Edge Caching cuts the time needed to serve cached WordPress HTML by an average of more than 50%! Transparent resources and pricing. Kinsta lets you know exactly what resources your sites have available. Gone are the days of blind upgrade requests and upsell attempts. Cloudways’ pay-as-you-go pricing plans can be complex and confusing, with potentially hidden fees and lots of premium add-ons that add up to the final costs.

Experience it with a 31-day free trial. Request a demo Why use Kinsta Automatic Updates? Keeping your plugins and themes updated shouldn’t be time-consuming or risky. Kinsta handles updates for you so your site stays secure and stable. Time is money No more logging in and manually updating plugins. Kinsta does it for you so you can focus on what matters. Stay secure Outdated plugins are a security risk. We update them automatically, test for issues, and roll back bad updates before they cause problems. Enjoy peace of mind A bad update can break your site, but not with Kinsta. Before updating, we take a backup. If an update fails, we restore the backup instantly—no downtime, no stress. Know when something goes wrong Before updating your plugins and themes, we capture a screenshot of your site and compare it after the update using visual regression testing (VRT). If a layout shifts, a button disappears, or something breaks, we roll back instantly and notify you. Pixel-by-pixel comparison If anything looks off, like a layout shift, missing button, or broken design, we automatically roll back to the last working version. Instant rollback protection If a plugin or theme update causes issues, such as broken layouts or missing elements, Kinsta instantly restores your site to its last working version before your visitors even notice. Detailed error message You’ll receive an email with the list of updated plugins and themes. If an issue occurs, we notify you and restore your site to the backup prior to the update. Take control with granular settings Every WordPress site is different, and updates shouldn’t be one-size-fits-all. With Automatic Updates, you have full control over how updates are handled so they fit your site’s unique needs. Schedule options Schedule updates daily or on selected days, and choose a 2-hour time window that works best for your site. Adjust sensitivity Control how strict the visual tests are so only the most important changes get flagged. Select test pages Define up to five key pages on your site for targeted testing after updates. CSS Selectors Skip dynamic elements like sliders or ads from testing to avoid false positives. Maintenance mode Enable maintenance mode during updates to keep visitors from seeing a broken or incomplete site. Notifications Get notified when updates run, when visual changes are detected, and if a rollback occurs. Kinsta just eliminated the biggest headache in the WordPress CMS: Outdated plugins & theme files. Matt Sullivan Founder & CEO of Torro Media, a Boston-based web design agency Let us show you how it works Our team is here to answer any questions and show you the full potential of the feature. FAQ What is Kinsta Automatic Updates? Kinsta Automatic Updates is a service that updates your WordPress plugins and themes daily. It runs visual regression tests to detect significant visual changes. If an issue is found, Kinsta automatically restores your site using a backup taken just before the update, ensuring stability and security. Is Kinsta Automatic Updates included in the free first month offer? Yes! If you’re on the Single 35k or WP2 plan, both your first month of hosting and Kinsta Automatic Updates are free. If you choose to activate Automatic Updates later, you’ll still receive a full 31 days free. Can I choose which pages are tested during visual regression tests? Yes. By default, Kinsta tests your homepage and four randomly selected pages, but you can specify particular URLs if preferred. Are inactive plugins and themes updated automatically? Yes, Kinsta Automatic Updates updates all plugins and themes on your site, even inactive ones. Newly installed plugins and themes are automatically added to the update schedule, protecting your site from vulnerabilities. What happens if an update causes issues on my site? Kinsta runs a visual regression test to detect significant changes after each update. If an issue arises, a backup is created immediately before the update is automatically restored. You can access these backups in MyKinsta under Backups > System-generated for up to three days. How much does Kinsta Automatic Updates cost after the free trial? After your free 31-day trial, Kinsta Automatic Updates costs $3 per environment per month. You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime via MyKinsta.

We knew there was a better way to work. That’s why we created ClickUp— first an internal tool, now as a way to fulfill our vision of making the world more productive.” More than just task management, ClickUp offers hundreds of customizable features including Docs, Whiteboards, Reminders, Goals, Calendars, and even an email inbox. The platform is fully customizable and integrates with over 1,000 other work tools, making it the optimal work management solution for every type of team. Read our interview below with Lydia Minehan-Tubic, HTML and CSS Engineer at ClickUp. Snapshot Industry: Productivity Software Company Size: 800 The Problem In discussions across teams at ClickUp, there were concerns about maintenance and reliability stemming from past experiences with the WordPress based blog. “From the DevOps perspective, we didn’t have anyone who was an expert on maintaining and operating the WordPress stack. As a result, it wasn’t getting the care and attention it needed. We either needed to hire someone to manage it or offload it to a third party. Maintaining an entirely separate set of infrastructure and tech stack for one part of the overall ClickUp organization requires effort that could be better dedicated elsewhere, which is why we went with Kinsta as that third party. Plus, we were in the midst of a major blog redesign, so it was prudent to reenvision hosting and infrastructure while the blog was also being rethought.” The Solution Knowing that Kinsta enterprise hosting could reliably take care of specific WordPress security measures on our blog meant our DevOps team could prioritize the security of our platform. “Kinsta provided migration services to streamline the process. We needed a reverse proxy for the blog which was also a service offered by Kinsta. We were told our current setup including CloudFront, reverse proxy, plugins, etc. should transfer over without issue.” The Result ClickUp saw improvements across the board, from transparency around blog analytics and visits to an easy-to-use staging site to excellent customer support. “Kinsta provides clear visibility into the status of the blog and our server via the dashboard. Additionally, the staging instance Kinsta offers makes it easy for our marketing team to review new features and bug fixes.” Daily backups also proved to be invaluable to the ClickUp team. “Kinsta provides daily backups of both the Live and Staging instances of our blog. You also can conveniently login to PHPmyAdmin from site info to access the database. Plus, you have visibility into error logs which can help with debugging.” And finally, “The customer support from Kinsta is top-notch, with representatives thoughtfully responding to requests within minutes .” Kinsta is a great third party provider for managing and serving WordPress blogs. They take care of security for you so you can focus on the exciting stuff like theme development and new features for your blog.

You can use it to perform any action and access any data. This can be a security nightmare! To keep your site safe, it’s wise to set up additional accounts that don’t have these elevated privileges. Fortunately, there are multiple ways to create new users in MySQL. In this post, we’ll explore all of the reasons you may want to add more users to your MySQL database. We’ll then show you how to create these accounts and manage their permissions for maximum security. Let’s get started! An Introduction to MySQL (and Why You May Want To Add New Users) The official WordPress distribution supports both the MySQL and MariaDB database engines. If you’ve weighed up the pros and cons, you may have opted for the latest version of the MySQL database management software. At some point, you might want to create additional users. In MySQL, each account consists of a username and password. It also specifies the client host or hosts where the user can connect to your MySQL server. You’ll typically create additional accounts when more people require access to your database. While multiple people could interact with MySQL from the same account, sharing login credentials is a security risk. If you detect any errors or suspicious activity within your database, then a shared account will also make it more difficult to identify the culprit. MySQL is a permission-based system. It enables you to control exactly what information each user has access to and the actions they can perform. Creating multiple accounts with different permissions is far more secure than relying on a single account with global access. When you install MySQL, it automatically creates a single ‘root’@’localhost’ superuser account. Even if you’re managing the database solo, it’s still wise to make at least one additional account. Doing so ensures that you won’t lose access to your entire database just because you encounter an issue with ‘root’@’localhost.’ This root account also has permission to access all your data and perform any action. Even experienced database users can cause serious damage with this level of control. For this reason, you may want to create a regular user account that you can use for day-to-day MySQL admin. You can then reserve ‘root’@’localhost’ for tasks that require elevated privileges. How To Manage Your MySQL Database When it comes to managing your MySQL database, you have two choices. You can use MySQL Shell, which is a Python, Javascript, or SQL interface and a component of the MySQL Server. This tool is available on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS for 64-bit platforms. Alternatively, you can use the free phpMyAdmin tool. Let’s take a closer look at both of these options. 1. Manage Your Database From MySQL Shell To enter the MySQL Shell prompt, open a Terminal or Command Prompt. You can then run the following command: > mysqlsh This opens MySQL Shell without connecting to a server. By default, MySQL Shell launches in JavaScript mode, but you can switch modes using the sql, py, or js command: Open the MySQL Shell In MySQL Shell, connections to MySQL Server instances are handled by a session object. If X Protocol is available, then you can use a Session object. Note that X Protocol requires the X Plugin. The X Plugin listens to the port specified by mysqlx_port, which defaults to 33060. You can create a Session object using the following: –mysqlx (–mx) For example, you can establish an X Protocol connection to a local MySQL Server instance listening at port 33060, using the following: shell> mysqlsh –mysqlx -u user -h localhost -P 33060 If the X Protocol isn’t available, then you can use a ClassicSession object. This object is intended for running SQL against servers using the classic MySQL protocol. To create a ClassicSession object, type in: –mysql (–mc) You can verify the results of your connection attempt using MySQL Shell’s status command or the shell.status() method. For example: mysql-js []> shell.status() To assign privileges via MySQL Shell, you’ll need to execute your commands as a root user. To achieve this, enter the following and then provide your MySQL root user password when prompted: mysql -u root -p Here, the -u indicates that the following parameter is a username, which in this instance is root. Instead of displaying the password in plain text, we’re using -p. This specifies that the password is not provided and that you’ll need to enter it when prompted. Using these parameters can help keep your root account secure. 2. Manage Your Database From phpMyAdmin If you prefer to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI), you may be able to manage the MySQL database via phpMyAdmin. With proper permissions, this interface can allow you to create new accounts, view and edit permissions, and delete accounts you no longer require. You’ll need to be logged in as root to perform these actions. You can download this tool for free from the phpMyAdmin website. Example of the phpMyAdmin dashboard. Info While Kinsta provides access to phpMyAdmin through the MyKinsta dashboard, we do not allow customers to create or manage database users with that tool. Customers who require changes to their database’s user table, can contact Kinsta Support for help. How To Create and Manage a MySQL User (4 Key Processes) Once you’re connected to your database, you can perform lots of different actions. Here are four key ways you can manage your MySQL user accounts. 1. Create a New User in the Database Server In phpMyAdmin, you can create an account using the Add a new user link. You can then use the text fields and dropdowns to configure this account: At this point, you have the option to assign global privileges. This grants the user unlimited access to all of your databases and tables. It can be a security risk, so you should only give these elevated privileges when they’re required. You can assign database-specific privileges after creating this account. To spawn a new account via MySQL shell, enter the CREATE USER command. You’ll also need to provide a username and the hostname. The latter is the name of the host from which the user connects to the MySQL Server: CREATE USER ‘exampleuser’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’; When typing this command, make sure to replace exampleuser and password with the values you want to assign to this account. The user can always change their MySQL password at a later date. In the above example, we’re setting the hostname to “localhost”. Therefore, the user will only be able to connect to the MySQL server from the system where MySQL Server is running. You may want to replace the word localhost with your server’s address. For example, if this user needs to access MySQL from a machine with the Internet Protocol (IP) address 11.0.0.0, then you’d run the following: CREATE USER ‘newuser’@’11.0.0.0’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘user_password’; If you want to create a user who can connect from any host, you can include the % wildcard in your command. For example: CREATE USER ‘newuser’@’%’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘user_password’; Alternatively, you can omit the hostname value entirely. This will have the same result. 2. Assign MySQL Permissions via phpMyAdmin By default, a new MySQL user doesn’t have permission to perform any actions. Even if they log into their account, they’ll be unable to create any tables or select any data. After creating a new user, you’ll typically want to start assigning them some permissions. To keep your database secure, it’s a good idea to give each user the minimum privileges required to complete their work. It’s also wise to regularly review their permissions and then revoke any unnecessary ones. You can edit a user’s privileges from phpMyAdmin’s Users dashboard. Granting unrestricted access may seem like the easy option, but it can put your database at risk. Unless you have a specific reason, you’ll typically want to avoid giving anyone free reign over your entire database. 3. Modify User Permissions From MySQL Shell If you’re using MySQL Shell, you can view all the privileges granted to a specific account with the SHOW GRANTS command. You’ll need to replace “username” and “localhost” with information for the account that you want to review: SHOW GRANTS FOR ‘username’@’localhost’; When you create an account, this list will be empty.

Kinsta Automatic Updates can keep plugins and themes current across all your WordPress sites while automatically detecting and recovering from changes that go wrong. By comparing before-and-after-update screenshots of a site’s pages, the feature’s visual regression testing can confirm successful updates and roll back any that fail. Daniel Pataki, Kinsta’s CTO, says this new feature “is designed to take the hassle out of managing WordPress updates.” “Keeping sites secure and up to date shouldn’t be a time-consuming task,” Pataki says, “and with Kinsta Automatic Updates, our customers can stay protected with minimal effort. By automating plugin and theme updates while ensuring stability through visual regression testing and rollback protection, we’re making WordPress maintenance easier and more reliable than ever.” Kinsta Automatic Updates is a premium add-on that costs $3 USD a month for each environment in which it is active. There is no limit to the number of plugins or themes you manage with the add-on within an environment. MyKinsta is home for plugin and theme updates Regular users of the MyKinsta dashboard for managing WordPress sites have seen Kinsta Automatic Updates come together in recent weeks. With the help of feedback from these users, Kinsta has transformed MyKinsta into a comprehensive resource for all things related to plugin and theme updates — from reporting on vulnerable releases to managing the native WordPress auto-update capability across multiple websites to the new Kinsta Automatic Updates feature itself. Discovering vulnerable plugins and themes Nothing confirms the need for automatic updates like finding plugins and themes that are not just out of date but also dangerously vulnerable to security breaches. You can check this in MyKinsta for an individual site environment by navigating to WordPress sites > sitename/environment > Plugins and themes. The detail below from the Installed plugins section of that page reveals that the installed version of Yoast SEO (22.2) is not the latest available. What’s more, it’s a release that is known to have possible security vulnerabilities. Version 22.2 of Yoast SEO is installed and active, but version 24.6 is available. Here’s another view that spans multiple sites and environments under the Plugins tab of the WordPress sites page: A view of plugin statuses across multiple WordPress environments. Above the “ACME Anvil Co.” has out-of-date versions of the Yoast SEO plugin active in two environments, one of which might be vulnerable. The plugin is up to date in both environments of the second site, with automatic updates being delivered by the WordPress native auto-update functionality. Managing automatic updates To apply automatic update settings for plugins and themes, you can return to WordPress sites > sitename/environment > Plugins and themes and then click the Change button on the Automatic updates card: Changing automatic update settings for a WordPress environment. The subsequent dialog asks you to select one of three update options: Manual (no automatic updates) WordPress auto-updates Kinsta Automatic Updates Selecting the plugin and theme update option in MyKinsta. If you select the Manual option, automatic updates will be disabled (including for any plugins or themes that already had automatic updates enabled). With this setting enabled, you will update plugins and themes individually within the WordPress admin dashboard or in MyKinsta (including using its bulk update capability). If you select WordPress auto-updates, the CMS’s native update functionality will be enabled for all plugins and themes. This well-known WordPress feature does not offer any safety net when an update creates unexpected problems for your website. Finally, selecting Kinsta Automatic Updates allows you to configure the new advanced update features with scheduling and emergency rollback on errors. Select this option, click Continue, and you can edit the settings for Kinsta Automatic Updates: Editing the settings for Kinsta Automatic Updates. Let’s run through the options in the above settings dialog for Kinsta Automatic Updates: Testing frequency: You can choose the days of the week on which you want Kinsta Automatic Updates to check for new releases and install any that it finds. Testing time window: The time of day you want the automatic updates to run. Sensitivity: The visual regression tests compare the pixels in before-and-after screenshots to determine if an update has changed a page’s presentation. This setting allows you to specify how strict you want that comparison to be. A higher value can detect more subtle changes but can also result in more false positives. Test URLs: You can add up to five URLs pointing to pages on your website that will be used for the visual regression tests. If you leave the field blank, the test will evaluate the site’s homepage and four random pages. Hide selectors: Some dynamic content can cause a visual regression test to fail. This option allows you to specify CSS selectors that present that content and hide it from those tests. Enable WordPress maintenance mode: Select this option to display a maintenance page when the updates are running. Configuring automatic updates for individual plugins or themes You can also enable or disable automatic updates on a per-plugin or per-theme basis. Below, within our list of site plugins, we clicked on the kabob (three-dot menu) beside the Ninja Forms entry: Changing automatic updates for a specific plugin. Choosing Change automatic updates in the example above results in the selection dialog we saw earlier, except that it is now targeting a single plugin: Enabling or disabling automatic updates for a single plugin. Reviewing the results of Kinsta Automatic Updates When an update is identified and installed, it appears within Plugins and themes > Kinsta Automatic Updates: Viewing the log of Kinsta Automatic Updates activity. Click Details to view information about the plugin or theme update. Click on the plugin or theme name to reveal the screenshots used for the visual regression tests: Update details with screenshots used for the visual regression testing. You can also receive email notifications of Kinsta Automatic Updates activity. Navigate to username > User settings > Notifications to enable email notifications for successful and/or failed updates. Powerfully simple WordPress hosting We’re fanatical about making WordPress maintenance simpler for our customers.

For us, the priorities for website hosting are reliability, support and security. It’s essential that our clients’ websites are live and working as close to 100% of the time as possible, are protected from hacking attempts and we get fast support if something goes wrong. Out of all of the website hosting providers I’ve used, Kinsta is the best by far for meeting those goals. Why do we use Kinsta for website hosting? Better reliability – our websites have never been as stable as when we moved to Kinsta. Uptime monitoring works correctly, no more false positives like 3rd party uptime monitoring tools. Website security is better due to multiple layers of security. Database optimisation, caching, and CDN are included, eliminating the need for 3rd party plugins or a Sysadmin. Website management is much easier due to the account permissions and hosting tools provided. I’ve tried many other website hosting providers, and Kinsta is not only far superior to most cPanel-based servers, but it’s also better than most other competing managed WordPress hosting providers. Kinsta eliminates the need for several additional plugins and significantly improves our websites’ performance. We’ve experienced a marked improvement in website reliability and speed across the websites we managed. Let me walk you through our journey and why we believe Kinsta is the best option for hosting websites, particularly for client websites we promote through SEO or PPC. How does Kinsta work? Most web hosts operate by offering the base server (sometimes with cPanel/WHM provided) and then offering you all of the tools you need to install WordPress, manage your database, and run your own server. Kinsta, on the other hand, doesn’t give you any access to the server and instead provides you with a pre-installed WordPress instance from which you can set up your website. The difference is significant. While most servers are only responsible for keeping their server online, Kinsta’s scope of support is far broader. Because Kinsta is one of the only web hosts who support the server and the WordPress installation, your responsibility for system administration is virtually eliminated. By supporting and maintaining our WordPress installations, Kinsta takes over many of the complex and riskier parts of keeping a website live, including maintaining and optimising the database, server-level security, website backups and hardware–software conflicts. Even though their responsibility ends with providing a stable WordPress installation, Kinsta also provides some support for issues faced in the WP admin dashboard. Increased website reliability Since switching to Kinsta, we’ve seen a significant increase in our website reliability. Technical issues that used to cause downtime have become virtually non-existent, and the performance under heavy traffic is very good. With other cPanel-based servers, I’ve seen issues with offsite backups and log files growing uncontrollably. This causes resources to be completely consumed, so things like the mySQL process can’t run. Unlike the shared server resources situation under WHM, Kinsta offers a completely separate environment for each website, ensuring that issues with one don’t impact the others. This is a critical feature that greatly enhances website stability. Furthermore, Kinsta’s server-level cache and its partnership with Cloudflare for its CDN services ensure that resources are efficiently served, improving load times and the overall user experience. Kinsta’s uptime monitoring system is vastly superior There are many third-party uptime monitoring tools to check if your website has gone down. However, my experience is that most are unreliable due to frequent false positives. Most hosting providers have security protocols that interfere with third-party uptime monitoring, leading to those tools detecting that a website has gone down, when it hasn’t, resulting in unnecessary alerts. This leads to a situation where actual downtime is difficult to discern from false alarms. In contrast, Kinsta’s integrated monitoring system only alerts us of real issues, which are rare. Most commonly, these are caused by actions like exceeding a media upload limit, situations we’re already aware of and addressing. It’s a far more trustworthy monitoring system than a third-party one. Furthermore, the built-in nature of these features eliminates the need for external plugins, and, by extension, their expenses. This makes Kinsta a far more reliable and cost-effective solution for our needs. The website security provided by Kinsta is much better The security of our servers is markedly better with Kinsta. Kinsta’s security guarantee includes robust active and passive measures to stop attacks in their tracks. They offer constant monitoring for uptime, DDoS attack detection, software-based restrictions, SSL support, and hardware firewalls. Furthermore, they enforce tight software-based restrictions and provide automatic backups, adding an extra layer of safety. Kinsta has an inbuilt integration with Cloudflare CDN, which offers a reverse proxy safeguarding the server against DDoS and other external threats. We still use Wordfence on our websites but have a much greater level of confidence with the server-level security provided by Kinsta. Website speed is better, and CDNs, caching plugins and server optimisation are all done for you Kinsta’s dedicated WordPress environment has significantly improved our websites’ speed and overall performance at Paramark. Unlike cPanel-based servers, where you often need to invest substantial time and money into setting up caching plugins and CDNs, Kinsta has these features built-in. This seamless integration of services eliminates the potential for interactions that might degrade website performance. By managing these aspects at a server level, Kinsta eliminates the need for individual plugins and enhances the underlying performance of our WordPress websites. The result is a faster, more reliable, and more robust web experience for our users. Website management is much easier When it comes to website management, Kinsta offers a far superior experience compared to traditional cPanel hosting. One standout feature is Kinsta’s delegated access. Unlike most cPanel hosting setups where granting developers or team members access means handing out the admin username and password, Kinsta makes this simple and secure. Access can be provided to team members who each have separate logins, with multiple tiers of permissions. You can check to see if they’ve switched on 2FA for added security. In terms of technical support, Kinsta truly shines. The support team are WordPress experts, who respond to issues in the live chat within minutes. This is significantly better than most other providers’ ticket-based systems, where you never know how long you’ll be waiting for a response. Kinsta support is also proactive, if a website goes down, they’ll automatically attempt to respond by restarting the PHP engine or clearing a server cache. Creating staging sites and migrations is much easier as well. Every new Kinsta website environment you create includes a .kinsta.cloud domain, meaning you can create a new website on a staging site separately from a live site. Making the new staging site live is as simple as changing the primary domain and running a search and replace. Importantly, you don’t need to point the domain to Kinsta until you’re ready to switch over. This is a stark difference from the messing around usually required with cPanel and Softaculous which typically involved a separate staging domain and migrating the staging site to live using local host. Conclusion At Paramark, we’re responsible for maintaining the websites of clients who get hundreds of visitors per day. We can’t afford to use anything but the most reliable and secure website hosting we can get, which is why we use Kinsta for the websites we manage. The inherent monitoring system of Kinsta outperforms third-party plugins, providing dependable notifications only when a real issue arises, thereby eliminating the risk of false positives. This feature, combined with the unparalleled security and reliability of Kinsta, gives us peace of mind and ensures our clients’ websites are always available when they need them. Moreover, the speed offered by Kinsta is simply remarkable. With its integrated resources such as CDN plugins and caching, our websites are faster than ever. These components are readily available, eliminating the need for hours of configuration. Since migrating to Kinsta, the benefits have been undeniable, marking a significant improvement in the performance and security of our clients’ websites.

Their exclusive partnerships in each region have helped them provide exceptional services to over 70 satisfied clients. Snowmad Digital’s expertise in SEO and SEM has enabled its clients to achieve remarkable results. For instance, Paniolo Ranch experiences 348% increase in conversions, and Alexander Homestead attributed 92% of the conversions to Snowmad Digital’s work. Some clients have earned from $150,000 to $180,000 with just their services alone. Discover how Elizabeth Nelson, founder of Snowmad Digital, partnered with Kinsta to provide her clients with better SEO, financial benefits, and a stress-free hosting experience. Snapshot Industry: Digital Marketing Agency Business size: 1-3 team members The problem Elizabeth Nelson’s previous experience with her web hosting provider was fraught with challenges. She described it as a “toxic relationship” because despite referring over 100 clients, she saw very little in return from it. Her past hosting provider relied on several buggy plugins, often leading to website downtime. Soon, Elizabeth was overwhelmed by the constant need to fix these problems. She recounted the extent of the problem saying: I didn’t realize how bad it was until I started counting how many hours a month I was spending fixing problems. The situation reached a critical point when a wedding planner client’s website was mistakenly redirected to an inappropriate site. Her previous hosting provider offered no help or refund and blamed Cloudflare for the fiasco. This ongoing battle took a toll on Elizabeth and her team. They realized it was time to find a new hosting solution. The solution To improve its search engine rankings and get more customers, Snowmad Digital carefully evaluated various web hosting options. They decided to switch to a provider that could offer fast-loading sites with robust security measures. Brian Jackson, founder of Perfmatters & Forgemedia, recommended Kinsta as the best option for Snowmad Digital. Elizabeth was impressed! She shared: When I saw what Kinsta had to offer, I was so impressed and knew right away that it was a HUGE improvement over what I was currently using. Kinsta offers up to $300 worth of built-in features. This eliminates the need to use multiple plugins to achieve the same result. Using fewer plugins results in a faster and more streamlined website, which is ideal for SEO. Landing page of Snowmad Digital “My goals were to achieve faster sites, reduce the number of plugins that could be potential security threats, get better support, and get paid for my work since I was already doing the site support after the sites were built,” explained Elizabeth. With Kinsta, Elizabeth is able to achieve all of these goals and provide a better experience for her clients. Powerful managed WordPress hosting Kinsta’s built-in premium features, such as Kinsta CDN, GCP’s fastest servers, and 99.9% uptime SLA intrigued her. The transition to Kinsta was a pivotal moment for Snowmad Digital, and Elizabeth worked closely with Kinsta’s support team to ensure a smooth migration process. Her initial impressions of Kinsta’s offerings matched her expectations and marked the beginning of a promising new partnership for Snowmad Digital. Worry-free migration process One of the biggest hurdles in moving to a new hosting service was the need to transfer large amounts of data without affecting the live sites. Kinsta’s experts assisted in creating a detailed migration plan that included staging environments to test the sites before going live on the new host. Following the move, Elizabeth immediately noticed a dramatic increase in site speed, attributed to Kinsta sites built over the Google Cloud Platform’s faster servers and premium tier network. Additionally, Kinsta’s hassle-free CDN, which boasts over 260 locations, played a significant role. Kinsta customers have experienced up to 200% faster websites after switching to Kinsta. 24/7 expert support and integrated tools Elizabeth also highlights the user-friendly interface of the MyKinsta dashboard, which has made site management much more efficient for her team. MyKinsta dashboard Customer service interactions have been an outstanding aspect of her experience with Kinsta. Whenever Elizabeth encountered problems or had questions, she emphasized that the response from Kinsta’s 24/7 support team was always quick and helpful – a refreshing change from her previous experiences. Value for money According to Elizabeth, investing in Kinsta is a financially wise decision. The fast-loading pages, stronger security protocols, and exceptional customer support have all proven beneficial. It has improved the performance of her clients’ sites and led to a more seamless management process, allowing her to focus on growing her business. The result Snowmad Digital’s clients have seen 348% increase in conversions with fast, secure and reliable websites powered by Kinsta. Some earn up to $180,000 per month. And by combining powerful hosting and solid marketing strategies, Snowmad Digital’s customer base has grown by 450%. Elizabeth’s journey started small with 10 clients on a 20-site plan, then to a Custom 60-site plan, and now with another upgrade on the horizon as she’s reached her 55th client. With Kinsta’s managed WordPress hosting, she could focus on growing Snowmad Digital without worrying about technical issues. Paniolo Ranch case study of Snowmad Digital “The biggest milestone for me was going from being a glorified freelancer to overseeing everything and making that big transition without losing any of the quality of service we provide.” Improved SEO with high-performance hosting “Kinsta has given me complete control from start to finish and has allowed me to provide my clients with the best possible experience. There have even been times when switching my clients to Kinsta and enforcing HTTPS alone have improved their site’s keyword placement and increased their ranking.” Since search engines like Google use page speed as a key factor for rankings, the faster load times provided by Kinsta have led to higher search rankings. This is crucial for competitive keywords, where a small edge can lead to significant improvements. “Ever since Kinsta made some improvements to my website, like faster loading times, SSL security, and other remarkable features, I’ve seen a drop in website issues. This boosted my client sites’ SEO, a key service I offer to my clients on a monthly basis. Thanks to the time saved, I can now provide more meaningful work for my clients. It allowed me to serve them better.” With HTTP/3 support, wildcard SSLs, and DDoS protection from Kinsta’s Cloudflare integration, Elizabeth is confident in the security of her clients’ sites. And because secure sites also help with Google rankings, her clients have seen higher keyword rankings, more user trust, and better conversion rates since switching to Kinsta. Maximizing return on investment After migrating to Kinsta, Snowmad Digital saw a significant improvement in its financial figures. The fast, reliable, and secure hosting from Kinsta meant the agency could spend less on fixing and maintaining its client sites. This allowed them to redirect funds into growing the business and stepping up their marketing efforts, which in turn brought in more revenue. For Snowmad Digital, investing in Kinsta really paid off. I’m happy to say that my sites rarely go down or go out of service, which saves me many hours. With less need to fix the site and deal with downtime, Snowmad Digital could use its resources more effectively, saving more in the long run. Its many benefits, such as better site performance, improved SEO, and 24/7 support, were worth every penny compared to her previous hosting provider. Stress-free hosting with reliable expert support With Kinsta handling the technical side of hosting, Elizabeth and her team can concentrate their creative and mental efforts on delivering quality services to their clients. And with a team of Kinsta experts supporting Snowmad Digital, Elizabeth feels confident in expanding her client base without sacrificing quality. Elizabeth describes Kinsta’s service as “super fast website hosting with the best support team in the world.” She explains: Whenever I have a problem launching a website, managing redirects, or encountering errors, I have an entire team to help me with any issue I face. I’m so grateful that I don’t have to go through the stress of waiting for days, sending multiple emails, or being mistreated for asking questions.

Virtual column Convert UNIX timestamp Scheduler Scheduler is a feature for Web Scraper Cloud which enables the user to automatize scraping jobs for a specific time. It can be set by navigating to sitemap Details page and clicking on Scheduler tab. Note! If an ongoing scraping job is in motion or it runs for longer than the scheduled interval, the new scheduled scraping job will start only when the previous one has finished. Scheduler configurations options The configuration options for scheduled sitemap scraping jobs are: Scheduler Time Zone - timezone which will be used when launching a scheduled scraping job. Scheduler Type - one of the 3 scheduler types, each type has different configuration options. Driver - Full(with JavaScript) or Fast(no JavaScript) driver. Request interval - page request interval in milliseconds. Page load delay - time period that scraper will wait for the page to load before extracting the data in milliseconds. Proxy - whether to use a proxy while scraping the site. A custom proxy can be selected only by Scale plans. These configuration options will be applied for all scheduled scraping jobs, for the specific sitemap. Scheduler types There are 3 types of scheduler configuration options available: Daily scheduler Select the weekdays and the time for which the scraping jobs should be started. Interval scheduler Interval can be set either by hours or minutes. If the interval is set by hours, scheduler will start scraping jobs on the round hours. Custom Cron expression scheduler If a very customized and specific scheduler is needed, for which the previous scheduler types are not fit for, set up a custom Cron expression. Was this page helpful?

For example if the scraper has to go through 100 pages, then 100 URL credits will be charged. If you are extracting 100 records from a single page, only one URL credit will be charged. Will I be able to scrape a specific site? From our own experience we can say that none of the universal web scraping tools can scrape every site. You have to try it out for yourself. Try Web Scraper Cloud for free with no investments. Do I need to input my credit card information to start free trial? No. How Scale plan differs from other plans? Scale plan is built for large volume scraping. It offers unlimited URL credits with limited running scraping jobs that you can scale up or down as needed. Can I upgrade or downgrade my subscription plan? Yes, you can upgrade your plan at any time during your subscription period. If you wish to downgrade your plan, you can schedule the changes, and the downgrade will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

Was thinking about coding myself a simple scraper for a project and then found this super easy to use and very powerful scraper. Worked perfectly with all the websites I tried on. Saves a lot of time. Thanks for that! Carlos Figueroa Powerful tool that beats the others out there. Has a learning curve to it but once you conquer that the sky's the limit. Definitely a tool worth making a donation on and supporting for continued development. Way to go for the authoring crew behind this tool. Jonathan H This is fantastic! I'm saving hours, possibly days. I was trying to scrap and old site, badly made, no proper divs or markup. Using the WebScraper magic, it somehow \"knew\" the pattern after I selected 2 elements. Amazing. Yes, it's a learning curve and you HAVE to watch the video and read the docs. Don't rate it down just because you can't be bothered to learn it. If you put the effort in, this will save your butt one day! About Web Scraper Founded in 2017 Located in Latvia, EU Serving over 800'000+ users across the world Obsessed with great customer support Frequently asked questions What is a URL Credit? A URL credit represents a single page loaded by the Web Scraper Cloud. For example if the scraper has to go through 100 pages, then 100 URL credits will be charged. If you are extracting 100 records from a single page, only one URL credit will be charged. Will I be able to scrape a specific site? From our own experience we can say that none of the universal web scraping tools can scrape every site. You have to try it out for yourself. Try Web Scraper Cloud for free with no investments. Do I need to input my credit card information to start free trial? No. How Scale plan differs from other plans? Scale plan is built for large volume scraping. It offers unlimited URL credits with limited running scraping jobs that you can scale up or down as needed. Can I upgrade or downgrade my subscription plan? Yes, you can upgrade your plan at any time during your subscription period. If you wish to downgrade your plan, you can schedule the changes, and the downgrade will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

Sitemap xml selector Image selector Table selector Element attribute selector HTML selector Grouped selector Element selector Element click selector Pagination selector Website State Setup / Sign-in CSS selector Web Scraper Cloud Sitemap sync Notifications Data quality control API Webhooks Scheduler Data Export Parser Replace text Regex match Append and prepend text Strip HTML Remove whitespaces Remove column Virtual column Convert UNIX timestamp Pagination selector Pagination selector is used to navigate through all pagination pages or to load all items with the Load more button. Pagination selector is always recursive, so all pagination pages are discovered. To extract data from pagination pages, data extraction selectors have to be set as child selectors for pagination selector. Configuration options selector - CSS selector for elements that change page after clicking on them. pagination type - a method that will be used to find pagination urls or click on pagination buttons. Pagination type Auto - automatically uses one of these pagination types. The auto option is recommended by default, with additional configuration needed when the auto option does not recognize the element correctly by default. Link - extracts pagination URL from anchor href attribute. Scripted link - extracts URL from javascript statement within href or onclick attribute. Attribute link - extracts URL from HTML element attribute. Text link - extracts URL from plain text. Link from any script - reads link from a script (window.location=, window.open). Click multiple times on next/more button - navigates through pagination pages by clicking on a button multiple times until no new records are scraped. Click once on multiple buttons - navigates through pagination pages by clicking on each unique button once. Use cases Handle pagination For example, an e-commerce site has multiple categories. Each category has a list of items and pagination links. Some pages are not directly available from the category but are available from pagination pages (pagination links 1-5 are visible but 6-8 are not). You can start by building a sitemap that visits each category and extracts items from the category page. This sitemap will extract items only from the first pagination page. To extract items from all pagination links including the ones that are not visible at the beginning you need to create a Pagination selector that selects the pagination links. Figure 1 shows how the pagination selector should be created in the sitemap. When the scraper opens a category link, it will extract items that are available on the page. After that, it will find the pagination links and also extract data from those. Figure 2 shows a selector graph where you can see how pagination links discover more pagination links and more data.

Processing Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. Restriction of processing Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future. Profiling Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. Pseudonymisation Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. Controller or controller responsible for the processing Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law. Processor Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. Recipient Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. Third party Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data. Consent Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. 2. Name and Address of the controller Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is: Web Graph SIA Ubelu 5-71 LV-2164 Adazi Latvia Phone: 0037126221763 Email: info@webscraper.io Website: https://www.webscraper.io/ 3. Cookies The Internet pages of the Web Graph SIA use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser. Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID. Through the use of cookies, the Web Graph SIA can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting. By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie. The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable. 4. Collection of general data and information The website of the Web Graph SIA collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems. When using these general data and information, the Web Graph SIA does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Web Graph SIA analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provid","links":["https://webscraper.io/tutorials","https://webscraper.io/screenshots","https://lv.linkedin.com/company/web-scraper","https://webscraper.io/about-us","https://webscraper.io/jobs","https://webscraper.io/downloads/Web_Scraper_Media_Kit.zip","https://webscraper.io/pricing","https://cloud.webscraper.io/","https://webscraper.io/documentation","https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-scraper-free-web-scra/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn?hl=en","https://www.facebook.com/webscraperio/","https://status.webscraper.io/","https://webscraper.io/","https://webscraper.io/cloud-scraper","https://webscraper.io/test-sites","https://youtube.com/@WebScraper/videos","https://webscraper.io/privacy-policy","https://webscraper.io/contact","https://webscraper.io/extension-privacy-policy","https://forum.webscraper.io/","https://dg-datenschutz.de/?lang=en","https://www.wbs-law.de/eng/practice-areas/internet-law/it-law/","https://webscraper.io/blog"],"mediaUrls":["https://webscraper.io/img/logo_white.svg"],"apiEndpoints":[],"isDynamic":false,"crawlTimestamp":1750749374972,"responseTime":950,"httpStatus":200},{"url":"https://webscraper.io/img/logo_white.svg","status":"SUCCESS","documentType":"image","title":"Web Scraper","description":"Web Scraper","links":[],"mediaUrls":[],"apiEndpoints":[],"isDynamic":false,"crawlTimestamp":1750749376529,"responseTime":0,"httpStatus":200},{"url":"https://webscraper.io/documentation/web-scraper-cloud/parser/regex-match","status":"SUCCESS","documentType":"web_page","title":"Regex match | Web Scraper Documentation","description":"All the documentation you need to run full scale data extraction.","content":"Regex match | Web Scraper Documentation Toggle navigation Web Scraper Cloud Scraper Pricing Learn Documentation Video Tutorials Test Sites Forum Install Cloud Login Documentation Installation Open Web Scraper Scraping a site Selectors Text selector Link selector Sitemap xml selector Image selector Table selector Element attribute selector HTML selector Grouped selector Element selector Element click selector Pagination selector Website State Setup / Sign-in CSS selector Web Scraper Cloud Sitemap sync Notifications Data quality control API Webhooks Scheduler Data Export Parser Replace text Regex match Append and prepend text Strip HTML Remove whitespaces Remove column Virtual column Convert UNIX timestamp Regex match parser Regular Expression is used to extract a substring from a string.

Remove column Virtual column Convert UNIX timestamp Virtual column parser Allows to create a new column by using data from one of the scraped columns. Virtual column can be created by clicking on + Add column button at the bottom of the parser table. Virtual column returns raw data from source columns. Setting parsers for virtual column won't affect data in source columns and vice versa. Virtual column parser can not be swapped with another parser by using drag and drop functionality. Configure options Name - virtual column name. Must be unique. Source columns - list of columns that data will be used. Separator - used if multiple Source columns are selected. Escape sequences as \\n\\r\\t can be used. Use cases Split fields into multiple columns Sometimes data points like street address, city, ZIP code and state are contained in one HTML element and can't be scraped in separate fields by using selectors. This is where Virtual column parser and Regex match parser comes in handy. To split the address field, create a Virtual column for each data point you want to extract and create a Regex match parser to extract it. See the example below. Please note that these regular expressions are written specifically for this address format. Source address: 3879 Angus Road New York, NY 10007 Regular expression to extract street: ^[^\\n]+ Regular expression to extract city: \\n([^\\,]+) - return capture group 1. Regular expression to extract state: , ([^\\s]+) - return capture group 1. Regular expression to extract ZIP code: \\d+$ Create columns with default values Virtual column in combination with Replace text parser can be used to create a column with a default value. In order to do this: Create a Virtual column parser by clicking on \"+ Add column\" button at the bottom of the parser table. Name your column and add any column as a source column. Save your parser. Create a Replace text parser and add the following configuration: Text to replace: [\\s\\S]+ Text to place: your default value Use Regex: checked Save your parser and download the data file with the new column.

By using this selector, the whole site can be traversed without setting up selectors for pagination or other site navigation. The Sitemap.xml link selector extracts URLs from sitemap.xml files which websites publish so that search engine crawlers can navigate the sites easier. In most cases, they contain all of the sites relevant page URLs. Web Scraper supports standard sitemap.xml format. The sitemap.xml file can also be compressed (sitemap.xml.gz). If a sitemap.xml contains URLs to other sitemap.xml files, the selector will work recursively to find all URLs in sub sitemap.xml files. Note! Web Scraper has download size limit. If multiple sitemap.xml URLs are used, scraping job might fail due to exceeding the limit. To work around this, try splitting the sitemap into multiple sitemaps, where each sitemap has only one sitemap.xml. Note! Sites that have sitemap.xml files are sometimes quite large. We recommend using Web Scraper Cloud for large volume scraping. Configuration options sitemap.xml urls - list of URLs of the sites sitemap.xml files. Multiple URLs can be added. By clicking on \"Add from robots.txt\" Web Scraper will automatically add all sitemap.xml URLs that can be found in sites https://example.com/robots.txt file. If no URLs are found, it is worth checking https://example.com/sitemap.xml URL which might contain a sitemap.xml file that isn't listed in the robots.txt file. found URL RegEx (optional) - regular expression to match a substring from the URLs. If set, only URLs from sitemap.xml that match RegEx will be scraped. minimum priority (optional) - minimum priority of URLs to be scraped. Inspect the sitemap.xml file to decide if this value should be filled. Use cases Sitemap.xml files are usually used for sites that want to be indexed by search engines, sitemaps can be found for most: e-commerce sites; travel sites; news sites; yellow pages. Best way to scrape the whole site is by using Sitemap.xml link selector. It removes the necessity of dealing with pagination, categories and search forms/queries. Some sites don't display category tree(breadcrumbs) if the page is opened directly. In these cases site has to be traversed through category pages to scrape the category tree. Making sure that only specific pages are scraped As in most cases, sitemap.xml contains all pages of the site, it is possible to limit the scraper so it scrapes only the pages that contain the required data. For example, e-commerce sites sitemap.xml will contain of product pages, category pages and contact/about/etc. pages. To limit the scraper, so that it scrapes only product pages, one or more methods can be used: Using RegEx - if all product URLs contain a specific string that other type pages don't contain, then this string can be set in RegEx field and the scraper will traverse only pages that match it. For example, /product/. This will prevent the scraper from traversing and scraping unnecessary pages. Setting priority - some sites prioritize specific page types over the others. If that is the case, setting priority will improve scraped page precision. Using wrapper element selector - if none of the previously mentioned methods are possible, an element wrapper selector can be set up. This method works for all sites and doesn't return empty records in the result file if invalid or unnecessary page is traversed. To set up the element wrapper selector, follow these steps: Open a few pages that needs to be scraped. Find an element that can be found only in these type of pages, for example a product title h1.product-title. Create an element selector and set it as a child selector for Sitemap.xml link selector. Set element selector to multiple and set its selector to (for example) body:has(h1.product-title). Select rest of the selectors as child selectors for this element selector. The key part of this method is that a unique element has to be found and included in body:has(unique_selector) selector. If the data from meta tags has to be scraped, html tag can be used instead of body tag. Scraper will extract data only from the pages that have this unique element. When using Sitemap.xml selector, set the main page of the site as a start URL. Was this page helpful? YES NO Success! Your feedback is sent. Warning! An error occurred while submitting feedback.

For example element selector might be used to select a list of items in an e-commerce site. The selector will return each selected element as a parent element to its child selectors. Element selectors child selectors will be extracting data only within the element that the element selector gave them. Note! If the page dynamically loads new items after clicking on a button then you should try these selectors: Pagination Configuration options selector - CSS selector for the wrapper elements that will be used as parent elements for child selectors. multiple - multiple records are being extracted (almost always should be checked). Multiple option for child selectors usually should not be checked. scroll - should website be scrolled to load more elements element limit (only visible when scroll enabled) - limits the number of elements extracted while scrolling - defaults to unlimited Use cases Select multiple e-commerce items from a page For example an e-commerce site has a page with a list of items. With element selector you can select the elements that wrap these items and then add multiple child selectors to it to extract data within the items wrapper element. Figure 1 shows how an element selector could be used in this situation. Extract data from tables Similarly to e-commerce item selection you can also select table rows and add child selectors for data extraction from table cells. Though Table selector might be much better solution. Related videos How to scrape multiple items within a listings page Was this page helpful? YES NO Success! Your feedback is sent. Warning!

Bear market A market condition in which prices of assets are falling, and investor confidence is low. It is generally characterised by a consistent decline in market prices, typically by 20% or more, over an extended period of time, often several months or longer.The term \"bear\" comes from the metaphor of a bear swiping its paws downward to attack its prey, as the downward trend of the market resembles the bear's movement.

We encourage all our users to secure their accounts and trade responsibly to experience the best in online trading. Securing your account Use strong and varied passwords. Make them as difficult as possible for anyone to guess. Use a secure web browser such as Google Chrome. Always install the latest software updates because they include security patches. Keep your login details secure and enable two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorised usage of your account. Use antivirus and firewalls to further secure your devices.

Learn more Platforms Deriv Trader Deriv GO Browse our FAQ What are the benefits of trading cryptocurrencies? The benefits of crypto trading are: ‍High potential returns: Cryptocurrencies are considered a high volatile asset class. This leads to higher risk, which could lead to higher rewards if your speculations are correct. ‍Diversification: Cryptocurrencies represent a different type of asset class that is not directly correlated with traditional financial markets, such as stocks or forex. This could potentially reduce your overall portfolio risk. ‍Accessibility: Cryptocurrency markets are accessible 24/7, allowing traders to buy or sell digital assets at any time, including weekends and holidays. ‍Liquidity: Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to have high liquidity, meaning there are plenty of buyers and sellers in the market. This high liquidity can make it easier to enter or exit positions without significant price slippage. ‍Decentralisation: Cryptocurrencies are typically decentralised and not controlled by any single entity or government. This decentralisation can be appealing to those who value financial sovereignty and want to reduce their reliance on traditional financial systems. What is the difference between crypto spot trading and crypto CFD trading? The main differences between crypto spot trading (trading the actual cryptocurrency) and crypto CFD trading (trading on the price movements) are: ‍Ownership: With spot trading, you own the underlying cryptocurrency and have to store it in a crypto wallet or exchange wallet. In CFD trading, traders can speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying assets. Note that exchange wallets are controlled by cryptocurrency exchanges, which means they control the private keys assosiated to your exchange wallet. If the exchange is hacked or goes bankrupt, you could lose access to your crypto assets. This is why many traders will transfer crypto to their private wallets. CFDs do not have this risk. ‍Leverage: CFDs allow you to trade with leverage, controlling a larger position with less capital. Cryptocurrency spot trading is usually on a 1:1 basis, although you can also have margin accounts for spot trading. ‍Short selling: It is possible to short sell when you trade cryptocurrency CFDs, but not in crypto spot trading. ‍Costs: Cryptocurrency spot trading involves commission. Crypto CFD trading has no commissions but instead will have a spread cost and usually come with daily financial charges (except on swap-free accounts). What factors can influence the cryptocurrency prices? Cryptocurrency prices can be influenced by various factors, including: Market demand and supply dynamics Regulatory developments and government policies Technological advancements and upgrades Adoption and acceptance by businesses and individuals Security and hacking incidents Investor sentiment and market speculation Macroeconomic factors and global events Media coverage and public perception of cryptocurrencies How can I research and analyse cryptocurrencies before making trading decisions? Before making trading decisions on cryptocurrencies, you can perform research and analysis using the following methods: ‍Cryptocurrency fundamental analysis: Evaluate the project's whitepaper, team members, partnerships, technology, use case, and community support. Analyse the project's potential for adoption and its competitive advantages. ‍Cryptocurrency technical analysis: Study price charts, indicators, and patterns to identify trends, support and resistance levels, and potential entry and exit points. Use tools such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence). ‍Crypto market sentiment analysis: Monitor social media platforms, online forums, and news sentiment to gauge the overall market sentiment towards a particular cryptocurrency. ‍Risk management in cryptocurrency trading: Consider factors like market volatility, liquidity, and risk-reward ratios when assessing potential trades. Set appropriate stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk effectively. ‍ It's important to note that investing or trading in cryptocurrencies carries risks, and it's advisable to seek professional advice and understand the risks involved before engaging in cryptocurrency trading.

Learn more Platforms Deriv Trader Deriv Bot Browse our FAQ What are the benefits of trading commodities? The benefits of commodity trading include: ‍Portfolio diversification: Commodities often have a low correlation with traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds. Adding commodities to a trading portfolio can help diversify risk and reduce overall portfolio volatility.‍ Inflation hedge: Many commodities, such as gold, oil, and agricultural products, have historically served as hedges against inflation. ‍Tangible assets: Commodities represent physical assets. However, it is important to note that paper commodity prices can sometimes temporarily diverge from physical commodity prices during periods of market stress, which means premiums have widened. ‍Global economic exposure: Commodities often reflect the state of the global economy and can provide insights into the health of specific industries and regions. ‍Risk management: For businesses involved in industries reliant on commodities (eg, agriculture, energy, manufacturing), commodity markets provide a way to manage price risk through hedging. ‍Seasonal trends: Many commodities exhibit seasonal price patterns due to factors like weather, harvest cycles, and consumer demand. Traders can use historical patterns to anticipate price movements and make informed trading decisions. ‍Transparency: Commodity markets are often highly transparent, with readily available information on supply and demand fundamentals. This transparency can help traders make informed decisions. What types of commodities are available for trading? A wide range of commodities is available for trading on Deriv, including: ‍Precious metals: Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. ‍Industrial metals: Copper, aluminium, zinc, nickel, and lead. ‍Energy commodities: NGAS, UK Brent and US Oil. ‍Soft commodities: Sugar, cotton, cocoa, and coffee. What is the difference between commodities spot trading and commodities CFD trading? The main differences are: ‍Ownership of underlying assets: In commodities spot trading, you purchase and own the actual physical commodity or a contract representing the ownership of that commodity. While in commodities CFD trading, there is no ownership of the commodity. Instead, you are trading on the commodity's price movements. ‍Delivery and settlement: Spot contracts typically involve the actual delivery of the physical commodity at a specified location and time. This is common in agricultural and energy commodities, where physical delivery is part of the contract. CFDs do not involve physical delivery. Instead, they are cash-settled contracts. Leverage: Leverage in spot trading is generally limited. If you want to buy a specific amount of a commodity, you typically need to pay the full purchase price. CFDs offer significant leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. While this can amplify potential profits, it also increases potential losses. ‍Short selling: With CFDs, it is possible to short-sell commodities. ‍Regulatory environment: Spot trading in physical commodities is often subject to various regulatory and logistical requirements, including storage, transportation, and quality standards. Regulatory oversight may vary by jurisdiction and commodity type. ‍Costs: Spot trading may involve costs such as storage fees, transportation costs, and insurance expenses, depending on the commodity. Additionally, commissions and fees may apply. CFD trading has no commissions but instead will have a spread cost and usually come with daily financial charges (except on swap-free accounts). Are there any storage or physical delivery requirements for trading certain commodities? For most commodity CFDs, there are no storage or physical delivery requirements. Since CFDs (contracts for difference) are derivative instruments, they allow traders to speculate on the price movement of commodities without actually owning the physical asset. CFDs are settled in cash based on the price difference between the opening and closing positions. ‍ However, it's important to note that some commodities, particularly in the futures market, may involve physical delivery if the positions are held until the contract's expiry date. In such cases, traders may need to take physical delivery or roll over their positions to avoid delivery obligations. It's essential to understand the terms and specifications of the specific commodity contracts you are trading. What factors influence commodity prices? There are various factors affecting commodity prices such as: ‍Supply and demand: The balance between supply and demand is a key driver of commodity prices. Factors such as production levels, weather conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in consumption patterns can impact supply and demand dynamics. ‍Economic factors: Economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and currency exchange rates, can influence commodity prices. Commodity prices often reflect the overall health of the global or regional economy. ‍Government policies: Government regulations, trade policies, subsidies, tariffs, and taxation can affect commodity prices. Political stability and geopolitical tensions can also have significant impacts. ‍Weather conditions: Weather patterns, including droughts, floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters, can impact agricultural commodities and energy commodities (eg, hurricanes affecting oil production in the Gulf of Mexico). ‍Speculation and investor sentiment: Speculative trading activities and investor sentiment can drive short-term fluctuations in commodity prices. Investor demand for commodities as a hedge against inflation or as a safe-haven asset can also influence prices. ‍US dollar strength: Since commodities are largely priced in US dollars, the strength of the dollar measured by the US Dollar Index (DXY) impacts commodity prices inversely.
